EG has it place as an excellent data farm for extracting subsets of data and a nice introduction to SAS for non-programmers  but is not an end all be all for a skilled SAS programmer, who needs more than 0.5gb ram and SSD drive speed.  

Most of the information I have on serviciability of EG is from SAS-L,
  not the commercial SAS sponsered list, and my own limited interactions.

  I submit at least one tickect every week with an EG issue.
  Most of the issues are never 'serviced' because
  they are 'unfixiable' for three reasons, issue is
  intrinsic in EG, hotfix was not installed or a more current
  SAS version is needed.

  It must be very expensive to service the large volume of EG problem tickets rather
  than the few originating from workstation or desktop SAS. The 9.4
  SAS install is only around 10gb and easily fits on a thumb drive?

  I have asked repeatedly for a summary of the one months EG tickets
  but I don't even get a written response.

  Currently my primary EG is at 9.3M2 with no plans to install 9.4.
  In August 9.3M2 will be 3 years old.

  Recent  9.3m2 29Aug2012 12.1
  Recent  9.4   10Jul2013 12.3
  Recent  9.4m1 15Dec2013 13.1
  Recent  9.4m2 05Aug2014 13.2

  I could install 9.4m2 in less than an hour, by myself on my workstation.
  Most hotfixes take less than 30 minutes. None of this requires
  IT support, but of course I do need admin priv turned on.
  I usually download the software or hot fix and unzip it.
  Then I call the help desk for a ticket, tech comes to my office clicks
  the setup.exe and run as admin, leaves my office and I send him a
  notice when the install is complete.

  The overwhelming response on the non-commercial SAS-List(SAS-L)
  is that EG is very hard to service or install. One very
  well respected advanced SAS programmer messaged that
  they never got it to work. Scheduled downtime
  of approx 30 days per year also may be an indication.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/481457756","","","","2015-01-01T15:47:22.501Z",""

Bricklin thought there must be a better way. He wanted a program where people could visualize the spreadsheet as they created it. His metaphor was ""an electronic blackboard and electronic chalk in a classroom."" VisiCalc - for ""visible calculator"" - became the first electronic calculator for the personal computer.

Violence is an important cause of physical and emotional trauma, and the scope of trauma care is broad, including care for survivors of unintentional injuries as well as injuries resulting from many forms of violence. Injuries and violence cause 5.8 million deaths each year worldwide, accounting for about 10% of the world’s deaths, more than the number of deaths that result from malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS combined.1,2 The primary causes of these 5.8 million deaths are road traffic crashes, suicide, and homicide, followed by falls, drowning, poisoning, burns, and war.2 In the United States, data from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study indicate the following among the leading diseases and injuries contributing to premature mortality: road injury (fifth leading cause), self-harm (sixth), and interpersonal violence (12th).3 
For the 2015 JAMA theme issue, the Journal is soliciting papers on trauma resulting from unintentional and intentional injury, from interpersonal and community-levels of violence, and from mass conflict, war, displacement, and natural disasters.  Manuscripts received by March 15, 2015, will have the best chance of consideration for publication in this theme issue.

Every year, approximately 12,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with cervical cancer. Thanks to screening, cervical cancer can often be found early when the chance of successful treatment is best.  The number of cases of cervical cancer and the number of deaths from cervical cancer have decreased significantly.  Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans must cover certain preventive health services for women including Cervical Cancer screening for sexually active women. How often you should get screened for cervical cancer depends on several factors noted below:
•	If you are age 21 to 29, get a Pap test every 3 years.
•	If you are age 30 to 65:
o	Get screened every 3 years if you only have a Pap test.
o	Get screened every 5 years if you have both a Pap test and an HPV test.
o	If you are age 66 or older, ask your doctor if cervical cancer screening is recommended for you.
Women are encouraged to talk to their healthcare provider about their risk for cervical cancer.

Note Dell I7 Laptops support 32gb ram and 4 sata3 ports, DVD, C drive, esata on laptop and
esata on docking station.

*My workstation is an T7400(circa 2008) with 64gb ram(DDR2) and two raid 0 SSDs(sata II) arrays
of 4 disks each. You can get these off lest for about $500.

SPDE is so fast because it uses all three indexes, without SPDE SAS chooses just one index
the one with the highest cardinality. Note indexes can be slower than a table scan.
Don't use an index if pulling 15% or more from the slow EG drives.

Workstation gridding og the sums of squares for regression analysis can be extremely fast.
This is why ordinary least squares is so fast in Teradate.
Might be interesting to compare regression on workstation and Teradata.

EG is a good data farm for extrating data for the workstation to analyze.
Generally datasets <1TB can easily and inexpensively be handled on the desktop.
EG is also good as a learning tool for non-programmers.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/482087654","uploadedfile:29037932","","","2015-01-05T05:54:11.622Z",""

He wrote in his journal that he made the discovery at 2:00 AM working with his now famous pendulum in the cellar of his house.  While it had long been known that the Earth rotates, the introduction of the Foucault pendulum in 1851 was the first simple proof of the rotation in an easy-to-see experiment. Today, Foucault pendulums are popular displays in science museums and universities.

Secretary Burwell and I are pleased to announce the 8th round of the HHS Innovates Awards, a Departmental recognition program that celebrates you and your creative approaches to problem solving.

Between January 8 and February 27, 2015, HHS employees are invited to submit nominations for innovative solutions that they or their colleagues have developed.

We know that innovative solutions to challenges of varying sizes are put forth by staff at all levels of this Department. The HHS Innovates Awards serve as a powerful mechanism for bringing forth the best of these solutions to the attention of colleagues, Department leadership, and the public at large.

Assuming age 55 with 8 years of service you really only have 1 option....A regular separation/resignation - In this scenario your benefits work like this:
FEHB - With FEHB you must be actively enrolled for the 5 immediate years preceding your immediate retirement. Any FEHB plan counts and coverage under your federal spouses policy counts also but you must be eligible for an immediate annuity.....
Upon separation/resignation you're given a 31 day extension of health insurance coverage free of charge starting the day after you separate. Once that extension runs out you are eligible to begin enrollment in TCC (Temporary Continuation of Coverage) The catch with TCC, which is very similar to COBRA coverage for private sector employees, is the cost. TCC costs 102% of the full insurance premium. Meaning you're paying the employee share and the governments share plus a 2% admin fee. This coverage can last for up to 18 months and is paid monthly in advance so early enrollment after separating is key to avoiding back premiums that go back to the 31st day extension expiration.

FEGLI - Your coverage ends the date you separate and again you are given a 31 day extension free of charge with the opportunity to convert to an individual policy within 60 days of your separation date. Your HR office SHOULD send you a separation package or something similar to inform you of this post-employment benefit and they SHOULD sent it quickly. In my experience this not something that is not handled well in HR departments.  Persistence may be required from the employee. You will also get the conversion forms as part of your separation package.

TSP - You will lose the privilege of payroll contributions but you can keep your TSP account indefinitely. IRS rules apply to your TSP account regarding withdrawals, etc.. 

NOTE: Because you have already achieved the minimum amount of Federal service (5 years) necessary to be eligible for a retirement you can DEFER your retirement until you reach the age of 62. At age 62 you may contact OPM to activate your retirement. There will be no penalties and the retirement will be processed as if you had just retired at age 62 with 8 years of service. Benefits are not eligible for reinstatement with a deferred retirement so basically this option is good for the money portion of your retirement. Benefits will have to be obtained elsewhere.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/483841006","","","","2015-01-08T17:47:13.346Z",""

If that wouldn't work, maybe you could get reassigned to the Philly office (Region 3).  8 hour employees can telework 3 days per week.  I have no idea what the distance is between Philly and Pittsburgh, but it might be doable 2x a week for a couple years until you hit full retirement age.

However, this type of retirement is considered immediate and therefore all of your benefits are transferable into retirement just like any other retiree....given that you attain minimum benefit requirements such as the 5 years rule for FEHB/FEGLI.

I had a couple of actions from Friday's call. One was to connect people with Sqrrl. Can you remember who was interested in the Sqrrl/Accumulo and their Splunk interface. I didn't want to mail bomb the group but rather to send an email that connects those interested with some key people at Sqrrl.

I REALLY like the live-editing and document management on here.  Having closed groups for private matters is also great too.  One trick I really like using is the ""notes"" in a group...you can use it like a file folder (since folders aren't an option on here).  For example, we had a director meeting coming up so I made a note with the agenda, and hyper-linked all the attachments so people could find everything in one place.

Essentially is surmises that when we are examining the challenge of employee engagement we aren't considering the whole employee in the life/world they live in. It suggests that our strategies - such as change management need to consider and could benefit from understanding the ""whole self"" of employees - otherwise strategies could miss the mark.  For example, when considering where employees spent their energy outside of work — the external self portion of the model [the whole self model] they found - ""Without fail, over 90% of respondents cited individual activities: cooking, running, knitting, cycling, reading. Outside of family time, few engaged in collaborative, group-minded activities, or really wanted to. Combine this with their roles as individual contributors during the workday and it’s clear why adapting to a more collaborative workplace wasn’t easy or comfortable for them."" - https://hbr.org/2015/01/employee-engagement-depends-on-what-happens-outside-of-the-office","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/486550043","opengraphobject:351561198742507","","","2015-01-15T18:05:49.948Z",""

Some of us didn't have office laptops at home and we had a need to send out an email that needed to have some photos and hyperlinks embedded into the body of the email. The Webmail option does not give us full email functionality so we needed to get into the full Outlook program. 

After two phone calls to the ITIO Help Desk, I was finally able to log into the VPN and the server site for my virtual network. But I ran into two problems. 

1) I had to go get an outdated laptop running an old version of Internet Explorer 9 and outdated virus definitions in order to log on. If we can only log onto the server network through an older version of IE, where can we go to download it? I tried the Microsoft site, but it only listed ""IE 9 for IT Professionals and Developers--Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008."" If we have to use IE 9, can't HHS provide a site we can go to and download it?

2) I was told to keep all of my files on my laptop hard drive because we don't have the space to store them on servers. I've been unofficially told to get an external device to back up files to, but we don't have the permissions to set auto backups to anything.

see attached upload(utl_sqz.sas) for cleaner view. Would like to use a fixed font in Yammer. Guttenberg where are you.

In the example here I reduced the wall clock time for a full table scan of
3,000,000 records from 9.78 seconds to 1.13 seconds.
This will scale to minutes, hours, days.

How I did it

   1. Reduced the record length from 306 to 168 bytes. As a side benefit
      Dollar sums should be more accurate.

   2. Turned compression off, compression increases the size of the 168
      byte dataset.

   3. Multiplied the dollar and cents by 100 to get pennies and
      rounded. Fractions of a cent are considered to be bad data.
      This reduced lengths from 8 to 5 or even 4 bytes without loss.

   4. Ran my utl_optlen macro, attached, which builds a length statement

* note you need to use a picture format or convert pennies to
  Dollars by dividing by 100 in your final step.

I find that most of my adhoc queries of large SAS datsets do not involve
fat variables like name, address or county name, If this is the case

a factor of 10 with lower cpu utilization. This allows higher
muti-programming levels with the same CPU load. All IT cares about
is CPU utilization.

METRO AREA).  What the OPM status means for NIH:
  
NIH facilities (Campus and leased offices) in Montgomery County, Maryland are OPEN, however, employees have the following options:  
 
Emergency employees (Tier I) report for duty onsite and on time, as scheduled, and remain for the duration of their tours of duty unless otherwise directed by their supervisor.
 
Non-emergency employees/teleworkers (Tier II) who choose not to report to their worksite may request unscheduled telework for the entire workday, request unscheduled leave, or a combination of both.  Those regularly scheduled to telework should do so for the entire workday.  Tier II employees reporting to the office are expected to begin work on time.
 
Non-emergency employees/non-teleworkers (Tier III) report to their worksites as scheduled or contact their supervisors to request (1) unscheduled leave; (2) LWOP; (3) to change their regular day off under a compressed work schedule; or (4) to rearrange their work hours if on a flexible work schedule.
 
Campus/NIH Leased Facilities Access: During and after this weather event, there may be limited access to the NIH campus/leased facilities, and local/regional issues may preclude safe commuting.  Safety of our employees is our first priority.   
 
ITAS: Employees are reminded that regular and ad hoc telework must be recorded in ITAS.

Thanks for all the online and offline construtive criticism, I think the code is much better now,
After futher offline communications with SAS_L, I implemented most of the suggestions.

1. Code should handle thousands of variables (macvar 64k limit was restricting?)
2. No global variable, user supplies an input and output dataset
3. Does not use the slow sashelp dictionaries, uses proc contents
4. Order of the variables remains the same as input dataset
5. Much more error checking, checks for empty and missing input datasets
6. Handles completely missing variables, previous code would try to set length to 0

Thoughts about SAS/WPS/R/Python

http://www.pcworld.com/article/2874832/microsoft-to-acquire-r-language-powerhouse-revolution-analytics.html

http://tinyurl.com/mo5leyf

“R is one of the most widely used programming languages specifically designed for statistical computing and predictive analytics, alongside SAS, MatLab, Mathematica and a number of Python libraries. Microsoft will use the software to offer cloud services and on premise applications for its customers to undertake big data-style analysis”.

SAS and WPS(SAS clone) are tightly integrated with R, R can read and write SAS datasets when SAS m IML is installed, although it requires full SAS not EG SAS?
WPS has PROC R.

WPS may become another future key product. SAS is pricing itself out of the workstation/desktop/laptop unbundled market.

Gartner had some positive comments about WPS(SAS clone) recently. 

Full WPS-SAS($1,900? unbundled full) SAS ($13,000? first year unbundled full SAS with Base/Stat/Graph/Access Oracle on power workstation).  Pricing is approx, very had to get exact costs.

SAS bundling cannot be understood. unbundled means you pay fro each product or you buy some products in different years.

I know SAS is very concerned about R,  WPS and Python with good reason.

Integration is the answer not parochialism","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/490022329","opengraphobject:351561199238435","","","2015-01-24T16:25:42.220Z",""

Here is a list of what I worked on today:

-Most of my time was spent on Wizehive 508 compliance. The 508 team was able to do a comprehensive check for 508 compliance on the Innovates submission form. They found a few things I need to fix to be compliant. Some of the things involves working with Wizehive.
-I also need to work with Wizehive to complete the PIA. I got the PIA draft back and there were many details I missed that I need to get from Wizehive. I did some work on filling in details and should have another draft of the PIA to send in by Wed.
-I finalized filling in information on our BPA SOW for form management systems

Release Date: 01/23/2015
Contacts: Margot Perez-Sullivan, perezsullivan.margot@epa.gov, 415-947-4149 or Suzanne Skadowski, skadowski.suzanne@epa.gov, 415-972-3165
SAN FRANCISCO – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement reached with Anadarko and Kerr-McGee is now final, allowing funds to be disbursed for cleanups across the country. 
 
The settlement secures payments of $5.15 billion to resolve claims that the defendants fraudulently transferred assets in part to evade their liability for contamination at toxic sites around the country. Of this total, approximately $4.4 billion will be used to clean the environment. This is the largest sum ever awarded in this type of a bankruptcy-related environmental settlement with the federal government. 
 
“Communities from the Navajo Nation to Henderson, Nevada are finally getting the funding needed to take crucial steps toward cleaning up toxic legacies that pollute their environment,” said Jared Blumenfeld, EPA’s Regional Administrator for the Pacific Southwest. “After decades of trying to avoid their environmental responsibilities, Anadarko is today paying billions of dollars to immediately fund these and other critical environmental cleanups.”
 
“This recovery will lead to cleanups across the country that will undo lasting damage to the environment, including contamination of tribal lands, by Kerr-McGee’s businesses,” said John C. Cruden, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “This result emphatically demonstrates the Justice Department’s commitment to environmental justice for all Americans, and it fulfills the Department’s promise to hold accountable those who pollute and those who try to foist their responsibility for cleanup on the American taxpayer.” 
 
An estimated $1.1 billion will be paid to a trust responsible for cleaning up a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that led to perchlorate contamination in Lake Mead. The site is located within the Black Mountain Industrial complex near Henderson, Nev. Fifty to 100 pounds of perchlorate are still seeping into Lake Mead every day, and the funds will allow that state’s Department of Environmental Protection to clean up the remaining underground sources of contamination.
 
The Henderson site is the largest perchlorate groundwater plume in the country. By way of the Las Vegas Wash, the plume has contaminated Lake Mead, which feeds into the Colorado River, a major source of drinking water in the Southwest. Perchlorate, a component in rocket fuel and fireworks, can interfere with the production of thyroid hormones, which are needed for prenatal and postnatal growth and development, as well as for normal metabolism and mental function in adults.
 
More than $985 million is expected to be paid to the U.S. EPA to fund the cleanup of approximately 50 abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, where radioactive waste remains from cold-war era Kerr-McGee mining operations.  Additionally, the Navajo Nation is expected to receive more than $43 million to address radioactive waste left at the former Kerr-McGee uranium mill in Shiprock, New Mex. The EPA is currently meeting with the Navajo Nation and the State of New Mexico to plan work to occur there later in 2015.
 
Kerr-McGee mined over 7 million tons of ore on or near the Navajo Nation from the late 1940s through the 1960s in the Lukachukai area, and from the 1950s to the 1980s in the Eastern and Ambrosia Lake areas. The Kerr-McGee Corp. was founded in 1929 as an energy company involved with oil and gas exploration and production, and uranium mining.  The company left abandoned uranium mine sites, including contaminated waste rock piles, in the Lukachukai Mountains of Arizona, the Eastern Agency of the Navajo Nation in New Mexico, and in the Ambrosia Lake/Grants Mining District of New Mexico. 
 
Exposure to uranium and other radioactive elements in soil, dust, air, groundwater and surface water, including waste rock piles and materials used in building structures, poses risks to human health.
 
In addition to the cleanups in Nevada and on the Navajo Nation, funds are also starting to flow to cleanups across the nation, including sites in Jacksonville, Florida, West Chicago, Illinois, Columbus, Mississippi, and Navassa, North Carolina.
 
On April 3, 2014, the United States Department of Justice announced this settlement, which was then subject to a period of public comment and judicial approval.  After considering comments from the public, the United States sought approval of the settlement, and on November 10, 2014, the district court approved the agreement as “fair and reasonable.”  The deadline for any appeals from the district court’s decision passed on January 20, 2015, without any appeals having been taken.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/491585508","","","","2015-01-28T16:57:27.362Z",""

One acceptable approach is to use a modest Alt-Text for the image and then put a true, text equivalent into the Notes field.

Because Microsoft is marketed to a wider audience and not just the US Federal government, their Accessibility Checker tests for a reasonable level of accessibility.  It does not reach the level of Section 508 conformance for documents or electronic files (depending on what it is you're specifically working on).  Using MS's Checker (available for Word, PowerPoint, and Excel) is an excellent start, but no, it doesn't reach the same technical level as Section 508's success criteria or HHS's standards for Section 508.

It IS certainly an excellent start!

Question - In the role of the PO what is the change in the IDC?

Answer - IDC stands for Indirect Cost Rate.
In the HHS codification of the Uniform Guidance Indirect Cost Rates may be found in Subpart E - Cost Principles (Section 45 CFR 75.414).  Information is also available in the Appendices in the Uniform Guidance, but 75.414 is the primary location.

Please note - IDC may also be referred to as F&A (Facilities and Administration) costs.

The PO should be aware of the following changes re: IDC (F&A):
1) The negoticated ICD rate must be accepted by HRSA.  The exception is when the programmatic statute or regulation requires a specific IDC rate reimbursement (e.g. a 'cap' on IDC that may be applied to a particular program).

2)  IDC must be included in the FOA.  The HHS FOA Template includes language for programs to include any statutory/regulatory limitations to IDC.

3) NEW applicants, may elect to charge a de minimis IDC rate of 10%

4) Existing applicants with a current negotiated IDC rate may apply for a one-time extension for up to four (4) years.  Grantees may not request a rate review until the extesion period ends.  This will allow grantees that may have an expiring IDC rate time to re-apply/re-negotiate their IDC without interrupting their current award.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/493402514","","","","2015-02-02T17:14:53.610Z",""

Fortunately, and to my surprise, the specialist who ended up taking care of us was from the USPHS! He was absolutely amazing.

It is my understanding that HRSA/HHS is requesting a waiver for the training grants, can you tell us about that?

Answer: 
Both applicants and HRSA staff should follow the guidance provided in the FOAs for training programs.

HRSA is very mindful of the requirements in the Uniform Guidance.  During this period of transition, HRSA is researching the regulatory direction provided in the Uniform Guidance.

If there are any changes from the guidance provided in HRSA FOAs for training programs, HRSA will notify our constituent communities immediately and provide additional direction. 

PLEASE NOTE - HRSA is working as part of a team with HHS and several other OPDIVs to assess our ability to continue to apply an IDC cap in our training programs.  This assessement will require review and approval by OMB.  The bureaus/offices with training programs will be informed immediately when there is additional guidance/direction from HHS or OMB.  As the assessment and OMB review are in progress; information regarding a 'waiver' is not for public/external communications.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/493408506","","","","2015-02-02T17:31:24.930Z",""

Question: 
I’ve heard that cost principles for hospitals were NOT finalized in the uniform guidance. Is that correct?

Answer: 
The Uniform Guidance does not include cost principles for hospitals.  The cost principles for hospitals may be found at 45 CFR 74 Appendix E.  

Please note the administrative and audit requirements in the uniform guidance are applicable to hospitals.

As well, 45 CFR 75 (the HHS codification of the Uniform Guidance) includes an appendix titled “Appendix IX, Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.”","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/493789433","","","","2015-02-03T12:35:24.312Z",""

An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the earth caused by the breaking and shifting of rock beneath the earth’s surface. Earthquakes strike suddenly, without warning, and they can occur at any time of the year, day or night. Forty-five states and territories in the United States are at moderate to very high risk of earthquakes, and they are located in every region of the country.  

If an earthquake were to occur, in MOST situations, you will reduce your chance of injury if you:
•	DROP down onto your hands and knees. This position protects you from falling but allows you to still move if necessary. 
•	COVER your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) under a sturdy table or desk. If there is no shelter nearby, only then should you get down near an interior wall (or next to low-lying furniture that won't fall on you), and cover your head and neck with your arms and hands. 
•	HOLD on to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with your shelter if the shaking shifts it around.

For additional information: FEMA offers online training on Earthquake Basics called FEMA Independent Study (IS) – 325. The training can be accessed by clicking here. Following course completion, you will have the opportunity to print your FEMA IS - 325 certificate.
Employees with Disabilities: The Earthquake Country Alliance offers advice on how to better prepare and survive an earthquake.

1. STAND UP for yourself! The Alternative Dispute Resolution Team at CDC is here to help you through conflict. Fellows & Contractors may also have access to this resource. 

2. KNOW what’s expected of you and be FLEXIBLE with management styles. 

3. EXERCISE the 3:1 rule. Identify 3 positive feelings to every 1 negative feeling you have about your job and/or environment. 

4. In RESOLVING a conflict, a Mediator is always there as a neutral party. You can seek mediation solely or have present parties with whom you are experiencing conflict. 

5. You can BECOME a mediator using your ILA Funds. Contact Dana Williams at gwj5@cdc.gov for more information!

OAuth requires a process for Developers to get Authorization credentials for their App so that Beneficiaries can connect their data to the app....

So this needs a framework for Developers to sign up and obtain those credentials....

So this in turn needs some type of Developer Agreement or Terms of Use...

This is all standard stuff in the world of the Internet where numerous platforms offer OAuth connections for consumers to connect apps together. So after some research I looked at various ""Terms of Use"" and decided that a BlueButton Developer Terms of Use document might look a lot like something that LinkedIn has used...

So here is a first draft of a ""Developer Code of Honor""

Here is an example where dolars and cents yeild the wrong total
but pennies yeild the correct answer.

Because $0.11 does not have an exact representation in binary we
lose a little each time we use the 0.11 in a calculation.
However since 11 pennies has an exact representation in binary
we lose nothing and we get the sum.

* if we use pennies we need to divide the result 100 or use a format
like I did below;

proc format ;
   picture mkedol (round)
           other  =  '000,000,000' (prefix='.'  mult=0.01)
;run;quit;


data billion;

   retain dollar 0.11 pennies 11;

   * 11 cents;
   * $0.11 dollars;

   do add=1 to 1000000000;
        sum_dollar   +  dollar;
        sum_pennies  + pennies;
   end;

   put sum_dollar  comma18.;
   put sum_pennies mkedol.;

      zipcode_summary.txt

Probably will not run in EG due to less than 1gb ram.
  
  Be careful setting maxvar and maxval, espcially with all posible pairings of variables.

  
Here is what the tool does

1.   Dataset level summary -- ie number of obs, variable types, static data
2.   Cardinality page  (primary keys, codes/decodes  number of unique
     values for every variable - EG fails here)
3.   Complete frequency for all variables numeric and character with less
     than 200 levels
4.   For variables with over 200 levels top 100 most frequent and bottom
     100 least frequent
     Least frequent are the more interesting cases.
5.   Proc means on all numeric variables
6.   Proc univariate on all numeric variables
7.   Special datetime  analysis
9.   Histograms on all variables with less than 200 levels
10.  Proc contents
11.  Frequency of all numeric variables Missing, negative, zero and positive
12.  Duplicates on single or compound key. Output printed vertically for
     easy comparison
13.  Cross tabs of every variable with every other variable top 16 levels
     (if selecetd)
14.  You can also selecet one variable to cross tab with all other variables
     max top 16 levels
16.  Maximum and minimum lengths to hold all numeric and character variables
     exactly (optimize)
17.  Correlation of all pairs of numeric variables sorted by largest
    correlation to lowest.
18.  Nice display of max and mins for numeric and character in one table
19.  List of identical columns ie date and date1 have equal values on all
     observations
19   One to Many, Many to One, One to Many and Many to Many
20   Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Statistics  
     Measure of the 'correlation' between two categorical(nominal Variables)
     * need to present as a list strongest to weakest
20   Printout of first 20, middle 20 and last 20 observations.

I ran it on SASHELP.ZIPCODES add a few variables to highlight some of the items above

Here are some of the intersting discoveries

1.  NO need for PONAME and CITY - They are exact duplicates? (note same number unique vals is also a tipoff)
2.  ZIP is the primary key
3.  Using optimum lengths reduces the size of the dataset by 72 bytes (fat variables should be codes)
4.  Longitude is very strongly related to numeric zipcode spearman cor of 0.96
5.  Greenwich meantime is obviously related to zipcode, since it is a measure of longitude?
6.  Outlier analysis through univariate
7   One to One      GMTOFFSET to TIMEZONE ( may not need both of these variables)
8   One to One      STATE to STATECODE  (need both?)
9   One to One      STATE to STATENAME  (need both)
10  The strongest association between unordered catagorical variabkes is STATE * STATECODE
11  The weakest is Rand_A * Rand_B","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/496292198","","","","2015-02-09T15:22:12.314Z",""

One thing we discussed was the challenge of using our time in a way that works towards our bigger objectives. Too often things end up going the other way and we foil our progress towards what's important to us.

I shared an approach I was trained on few years ago. I haven't always diligently applied it. Go figure! I revisited it to see how practical it is. It's certainly something that you have to adapt to your own style.

We are planning to set up a small working session to look at some of the features of Outlook that may help. Let us know if you'd be interested in joining us for an hour. We could do it via Webex so no-one has to travel. As the link below indicates - the technology is only a small part of the solution, but it can help.

Are you thinking about submitting an entry for an HHS Innovates Award?  Or just curious about how this program recognizes and rewards employees who have developed creative solutions?   If so, we invite you to join us for a special virtual town hall event on February 10 from 2-3 PM ET in the HHS IDEA Lab Yammer Group.  This is a great opportunity to chat virtually with members of the Awards Committee and hear from colleagues who have won Innovates Awards. During the hour, you can ask questions, or just listen in on the dialogue. If you’ve never experienced a Yam Jam, or have questions you want answered, consider joining us!

Julia and I have had a couple of great chats.  One thing we discussed was the challenge of using our time in a way that works towards our bigger objectives. Too often things end up going the other way and we foil our progress towards what's important to us.  I shared an approach I was trained on few years ago. http://www.tmiworld.com/time-manager-microsoft-outlook (http://www.tmiworld.com/time-manager-microsoft-outlook) . I haven't always diligently applied it. Go figure! I revisited it to see how practical it is. It's certainly something that you have to adapt to your own style.  We are planning to set up a small working session to look at some of the features of Outlook that may help. Let us know if you'd be interested in joining us for an hour. We could do it via Webex so no-one has to travel. As the link below indicates - the technology is only a small part of the solution, but it can help.  Overall our purpose partner meetings have worked well. It ended up making me more accountable on something I've tried to use on and off for years.

The HHS Innovates is an Awards Program aimed at building a culture of innovation at the Department of Health and Human Services through facilitating the exchange of innovative ideas and showcasing creative approaches developed by our employees to solve tough problems. This program recognizes and rewards employee-led innovation, and helps to spread promising solutions across the Department and beyond.  More information about the awards program can be found here: http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/what-we-do/hhs-innovates/
Each year, HHS employees are invited to submit innovations they have developed.  The innovations are initially reviewed by an internal committee and highest scored innovations are posted for online employee voting. The voting process provides an important mechanism through which good ideas are shared across the Department, and employees are invited to provide their feedback on the top innovations. The winners are personally recognized by the Secretary in an awards ceremony, and also receive a certificate signed by the Secretary, which is placed in their employee performance file.

•	I know there have been many changes in this round of HHS Innovates.  Let’s ask the HHS Innovates Coordinator, Elizabeth Kittrie, to highlight some of the new features.  Elizabeth, what’s new this round?
We’ve made a lot of great changes this round.  We’ve added six new submission categories that focus on high impact areas or relevance (these are: transforming health, optimizing human services, creating building blocks for success at every stage in life, enhancing operational effectiveness, biggest bang for our buck, and out-of-the-box solution).  We’ve streamlined the nomination process (e.g. we’ve added new questions, and we allow entrants to submit collateral materials).  We’ve improved the award selection process, as well as found opportunities to provide additional recognition for meritorious entrants.  You can read more about these changes here http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/what-we-do/hhs-innovates/ or in our blog post on this topic at http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/2015/01/05/hhs-innovates-launches-8th-round-awards-new-improved-submission-process/","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/496936621","opengraphobject:351561199393307","","","2015-02-10T19:15:30.507Z",""

The Uniform Guidance indicates that each NOA list specific goals/objectives for each grantee. Has this time consuming work been factored in to the calendar/process to get the NOA issued?


The Uniform Guidance describes the information contained in a Federal award at 45 CFR 75.210.  

In section 75.210 (d) Federal Award Performance Goals, we at HRSA are required to provide an indication of the timing and scope of expected performance.  In the “reporting requirements” section of the Notice of Award (NoA) HRSA describes our expectations for annual, semi-annual or quarterly reporting.  

The Uniform Guidance also states HRSA “may include specific performance goals, indicators, milestones, or expected outcomes with an expected timeline for accomplishment,” where appropriate.  This should NOT be interpreted as a requirement for NoAs to include grantee-specific goals/objectives.  NOAs may include programmatic goals/objectives under the “program-specific terms” section, which would be applicable to all the grantees under the program.  This is not a requirement, it is an option.  The programmatic performance requirements should be aligned with the agency strategic goals.  

It is anticipated that program offices will generally obtain grantee-specific goals/objectives from grant applications, performance reports, progress reports, quarterly/semi-annual/annual reporting requirements, TA calls, site visits, etc.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/496956216","","","","2015-02-10T20:08:13.829Z",""

•	One option to correct this issue is to have users install Java 8 Update 25.

•	Another way to resolve it is by updating the Java options.  Open the java control panel -> Advanced tab -> Advanced Security Settings -> Uncheck TLS 1.1 and 1.2 -> apply changes.  

General Physics is working with SkillSoft and their hosting group on this to see if there is a more permanent solution where settings don't need to be updated.

Reminder in case you don’t have this on your calendar yet! Today is the HHS Digital Media Round Table Call - where we discuss timely topics, questions, share news and learn from each other’s experience –

Once a month a group of people jump on an old media technology (the telephone) to talk about new media issues (not the telephone). If you have a question or topic that you’d like to throw out to the group, you can send it ahead of time, or just plan on bringing it up yourself. Or just jump in other people’s topics. Or just silently, lurkingly, listen in…

Join us!

https://github.com/ekivemark/claims

I am hoping that other interested parties (eg. Payers) will contribute to this work so that we have some level of commonality.  

Since Medicare publishes self-entered data as part of BlueButton and these self-entered data segments correlate with sections of the Clinical Document Architecture I have used a <source></source> field within each data segment with a value of ""patient"" or ""mymedicare.gov""  to identify where the data came from.

Windows XP was designed with more emphasis on multimedia features such as Web publishing and streaming audio and video. It was built on the same platform as Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system and was the first consumer operating system since Windows 95 that has an entirely new underlying code base. Microsoft ended support of XP in 2013, stating that 12 years was the longest they had supported any previous operating system.

While the committees actual scoring sheet is not yet available, below is the scoring criteria for selection which is on our website:

Step 2:  HHS Innovates Committee Scoring and Selection of Finalists
 
Proposals that are cleared by agency leadership will be evaluated by the HHS Innovates Committee based on the following criteria:
 1.Significance to the HHS/OPDIV Mission or to Operational Efficiency [25 points]
 2. Novelty of the Innovation [25 points]
 3.Impact/Return-on-Investment [25 points]
 4.Potential for and Scalability and Transferability across HHS [25 points]
 
The top scoring innovation in each category (Transforming Health, Optimizing Human Services, Creating Building Blocks for Success at Every Stage in Life, Enhancing Operational Effectiveness, Biggest Bang for Our Buck, and Out-of-the Box Solution) will move onto the finals.  In cases where there is a tie within a category, the Awards Committee may select multiple innovations to move onto the finals.  Those selected as finalists will be asked to participate in a brief interview with members of the HHS Innovates Committee.
 
Highly meritorious innovations that do not proceed to the finals will be eligible to receive written recognition from the Deputy Secretary.


Unfortunately, prior applications are no longer available on our new website.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Once the pilot is completed the system that has been reviewed is usually rolled out, sometimes in phases to the rest of the population.  On a few occasions some organizations will deploy a system without the phased approach, which I think is risky.  However, sometimes organizations have timelines they must meet and the old system has expired and business needs to be accomplished using the new system.  I hope this was helpful.  Feel free to ask more questions if you need clarification.  Maybe we have other Change Management Specialists here that can chime in.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/498545558","","","","2015-02-13T20:47:50.865Z",""

 •Stay indoors during the storm.

 •Walk carefully on snowy, icy, walkways.

 •Avoid overexertion when shoveling snow. Overexertion can bring on a heart attack—a major cause of death in the winter. Use caution, take breaks, push the snow instead of lifting it when possible, and lift lighter loads.

 •Keep dry. Change wet clothing frequently to prevent a loss of body heat. Wet clothing loses all of its insulating value and transmits heat rapidly.

 •Signs of Frostbite: Occurs when the skin and body tissue just beneath it freezes. Loss of feeling and white or pale appearance in extremities, such as fingers, toes, earlobes, face, and the tip of the nose.
What to Do: Cover exposed skin, but do not rub the affected area in an attempt to warm it up. Seek medical help immediately.

 •Signs of Hypothermia: Dangerously low body temperature. Uncontrollable shivering, memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, slurred speech, drowsiness, and apparent exhaustion.
What to Do: If symptoms of hypothermia are detected take the person’s temperature. If it is below 95°, seek medical attention immediately. Get the victim to a warm location. Remove wet clothing. Warm the center of the body first by wrapping the person in blankets or putting on dry clothing. Give warm, non-alcoholic beverages if the victim is conscious. Seek medical help immediately. ◦The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends, if you detect symptoms of frostbite, seek medical care. Because frostbite and hypothermia both result from exposure, first determine whether the victim also shows signs of hypothermia. Hypothermia is a more serious medical condition and requires emergency medical assistance.
 
•Drive only if it is absolutely necessary. If you must drive: travel in the day; don’t travel alone; keep others informed of your schedule; stay on main roads and avoid back road shortcuts.

•Let someone know your destination, your route, and when you expect to arrive. If your car gets stuck along the way, help can be sent along your predetermined route.

•If the pipes freeze, remove any insulation or layers of newspapers and wrap pipes in rags. Completely open all faucets and pour hot water over the pipes, starting where they were most exposed to the cold (or where the cold was most likely to penetrate).

•Maintain ventilation when using kerosene heaters to avoid build-up of toxic fumes. Refuel kerosene heaters outside and keep them at least three feet from flammable objects.

 •Conserve fuel, if necessary, by keeping your residence cooler than normal. Temporarily close off heat to some rooms.
 •If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat on in your home, set to a temperature no lower than 55ºF.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/499605888","","","","2015-02-17T13:20:03.078Z",""

QUESTION: 
In the new Uniform Guidance, are grantees called “grantees?”   And are applicants called “applicants?”

ANSWER:
Applicants are called “applicants” in the Uniform Guidance.
The term “grantee” is REMOVED from the Uniform Guidance.

Grantees are referred to as a “recipient” and/or “non-federal entity.”

This is basically because “recipients” may be in receipt of a variety of types of ‘awards’ available across the entire federal government (e.g. ‘grant’ or a ‘cooperative agreement’ just to name two).","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/503138837","","","","2015-02-25T14:27:07.584Z",""

QUESTION:
Does the Uniform Guidance restrict the transfer of funds or re-budgeting within an award to 10% (from 25%)?

ANSWER:
No.  The Uniform Guidance does not change current HRSA Grant Policy/Operations.  The Uniform Guidance does provide HRSA with the ability to restrict the transfer of funds, as appropriate, for direct cost categories or programs.  The Uniform Guidance states that the HHS awarding agency “may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds….. (when) the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget.” 

At this time, HRSA choses to follow current grants management practices in alignment with the Grants Policy Administration Manual (GPAM) chapter 903.4.2.1.1 Significant Rebudgeting.  The GPAM states, “Rebudgeting, or moving funds between direct cost budget categories in an approved budget, is considered significant when cumulative transfers for a single budget period exceeds 25 percent of the total approved budget (inclusive of direct and indirect costs and federal funds and required matching or cost sharing).  The base used for determining significant rebudgeting excludes carryover balances but includes any amounts awarded as supplements.”

Please note: HHS is working with all OPDIVs to update the GPAM.  Any future modifications to the GPAM that modify this requirement will be communicated to the Bureaus/Offices.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/503276175","","","","2015-02-25T19:34:22.305Z",""

Title:  How Good Workplace Communication Improves Employee Morale

Summary: Communication can instantly start off on the wrong foot when it’s approached negatively rather than positively. When information is transferred insufficiently or inaccurately, workplace productivity goes down. The good news is that the opposite is also true. Good workplace communication can have positive effects on performance including increased productivity, higher employee morale, repeat business, improved employee retention, and a healthier work environment overall.

Viewing a SAS dataset in Excel

If you highlight sashelp.cars and type xlsh in the old text editor
command line then sashelp.class will be opened in excel.

* if you put these two macros in your autocall library member c:\oto\xlsh.sas.
You do not have to store them in two macros.
You also need SAS Access to PCFiles. Could substitute ODS excel if you have 9.4.
Also you need options cmdmac.

%macro xlsh /cmd ;
   store;note;notesubmit '%xlsha;';
   run;
%mend xlsh;

%macro xlsha/cmd;

    filename clp clipbrd ;
    data _null_;
     infile clp;
     input;
     put _infile_;
     call symputx('argx',_infile_);
    run;

    %let __tmp=%sysfunc(pathname(work))\myxls.xlsx;

    data _null_;
        fname=""tempfile"";
        rc=filename(fname, ""&__tmp"");
        put rc=;
        if rc = 0 and fexist(fname) then
       rc=fdelete(fname);
    rc=filename(fname);
    run;

    libname __xls excel ""&__tmp"";
    data __xls.%scan(__&argx,1,%str(.));
        set &argx.;

Poor man's program versioning( I also set autosave to 1 minute )

    Tap the middle mouse button or function key and a time stamped version
    of the program will be saved in c:\ver and a production
    version in the SAS present program folder.

    1. Create a versioning directory call c:\ver
    2. The top of editor window
       %let pgm=utl_RogPgm;
    3. In your autoexec
       %Let _q=%sysfunc(int(%sysfunc(time())));
    4, On function key or better on middle mouse button.
       pgm;file &pgm..sas;file ""c:\ver\&pgm.&_q..sas"";%let &_q=%eval(0&_q+1);
    5. When you hit the fuction key or middle mouse button a time stamped
       version of you program will be saved in c:\ver\utl_RogPgm20145.sas


My invocation of SAS

E:\sashome\SASFoundation\9.3\sas.exe
-work e:\wrk
-sasuser e:\etc
-RLANG
-autoexec c:\oto\tut_Oto.sas
-sasinitialfolder  .
-nosplash
-autosaveloc c:\ver\pgm.sas
-config e:\cfg\sasv9.cfg

-sasautos c:\oto

   Very fast point and shoot editing and code submit in the old text editor.

   suppose you have submit on the right mouse key

   Use the ALT key as you hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse
   to select a rectangular block (or column) of te

   After the highlight above hit the right mouse button and the highlighted code will
   be executed.

   type change x y on the command line

   then x will be changed to y only in the highlighted area.

   Simple actions like typing 860 on the command line will take to line
   860. On long programs I sometimes jot down the location of
   keta lines.

   Example 1 -- Just a dumb script
   --------------------------------

   1;F ' ';MARK;HOME;2;HOME;MARK;HOME;STORE;HOME;UNMARK;

   If the first line in active editor contains

   000001 %Macro MyLongMacroName

   This script will put MyLongMacroName into the paste buffer.
   You can then paste MyLongMacroName anywhere you want.
   (This only works on windows). Try it, just copy
   the one line script to the command line.

   My function keys I turn off scrool bars and use f1 and f2

SharePoint 2013 will soon be in production.  Baltimore has done some great things with the system to centrally store documents and automate manual paper processes to get actions cleared.

Rick is our SharePoint expert but I think we make much progress by looking at the actual functionality of the sites and how to manage by project control number.   Anybody willing????","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/503984293","","","","2015-02-26T23:37:50.815Z",""

• Make sure flashlights and battery-powered radios are working, and keep extra batteries, candles and matches on hand.
• Unplug sensitive appliances such as the TV, VCR, computer and microwave. If the power goes off, turn off all major electrical appliances.
• Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed. If you lose power, frozen food will generally keep for 48 hours. Discard perishable food that has been at 40 degrees for more than two hours. Odor or appearance is not an indicator that food is safe. When in doubt, throw it out. 
• If you use an emergency-heating source such as a wood stove, kerosene heater or fireplace, keep fuels away from the flames and ventilate properly. Never leave a fire unattended.
• If it seems likely that your home will be without heat for several days, drain your water pipes.
• If you use a generator, read all the instructions that accompany it and be aware of the hazards that come with misuse. Use a qualified electrician to connect a generator to the house wiring. Never run a gasoline-powered generator in the house-the fumes are deadly.

Since there is no way to prevent nature's winter storms, being prepared in your best defense:
• Create a family disaster plan and practice it regularly.
• Learn and teach others in your family how to turn off electricity, gas and water.
• Store extra blankets and warm clothes where you can find them easily. Layer winter clothing to trap body heat.
• Keep emergency telephone numbers with you.
• Have a first aid kit on hand.
• Stock up on drinking water and canned or dried foods. Be sure to include a non-electric can opener with your supplies.
• Have at least a week's supply of prescription medications on hand.
• Fill your car with gasoline.
• Have cash available.

Hi Team

see attached utl_fasterjobs.sas

* I was asked to subset a 1.6 billion sas dataset
  for 6 hcpcs_cds for just March and April 2013
  No usefull indexes;

Timings for four methods

   1. 32 minutes for traditional method
   2. 8 minutes for the systask below( 6 concurrent jobs - could do more should be linear)
   3. ? minutes Modulo method not run. 6 minutes?
   4. 9 minutes using grid (6 concurrent jobs could easily run. Grid has more overhead?)

This is a very general method that applies to any SAS dataset
that is sorted. If the data is not sorted you can partition
the large dataset using mod(any large unique integer,x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)=0
to process 8 mutually exclusive
partitions of the dataset. Both methods require that
you use a view to concatenate the result. Try  not
to materialize the concatenation, unless absolutely needed.
Sometimes that partitions are useful individually?

Methods 1 and 2 will run much faster on an inexpensive
windows/linux power workstation like the $600 Dell T7400's
off lease on EBAY or any more expensive Dell I7.
Need at least 8 cores and SPDE?

You can run jobs concurrently with the grid or if
you have access to the operating system you can use
systask as shown below.

Here is the 32 minute version

* first method 32 minutes;

data top_xxxxxxxxxxx;
     set xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx(
          where=(srvc_month in ('01APR2013'd,'01MAR2013'd) and

Dear Health Data Leads,

First I would like to sincerely thank you all for your prompt responses to the recent Sunlight Foundation FOIA request for government wide metadata about the resources in our catalogs. Your thorough responses have helped OMB to provide timely reply to this request.

Next, I am happy to inform you that we are working on launching a new version of HealthData.gov this spring. There are several goals for the revitalization of this public face of the HHS Health Data Initiative including advancing the platform's technology base for improved data and catalog management capabilities, improving platform usability and administration functions, and creating a space that will support various user communities. This procurement process will also take advantage of the new HHS Buyer's Club<http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/2014/06/24/membership-has-its-privileges/> pathway for innovative IT procurements allowing more agile development cycles for a more effective implementation and reduced costs over the life of the project.

Finally I'm reminding you that the Health Datapalooza<http://www.healthdatapalooza.org> is coming in early June. Once again I'll lead the Datalab, a session where I'll match you (or your colleague), the data owner, with one of your interesting or effective data users. The goal is to demonstrate how and why the data was collected with how it is alternatively useful when the data is made openly available. My ask is that you please connect me with your suggested data users now so that we can begin fleshing out the session.  I'd Iike to have an introduction to your recommended data user by Friday March 20 pls. We need ample time to evaluate the candidates, and for them to organize their travel to the event in June.

As always, thank you for your efforts toward a more robust HDI.

Damon

Announcements from ASPA
1.	Alas, Kathryn has moved on to NASA. She'll be missed and we hope to still connect with her in the Federal Digital Communications arena. She was instrumental to getting social media policies across HHS changed to help all of us be able to do our jobs more easily
2.	Sally will be stepping in to take on TOS and other new media activities with Nicholas Garlow. 

Reminder to stay in touch throughout the month through the List Serve and Yammer.

Other notes!

From Brooke Leggins -
Thanks for all the support for National Women's and Girls HIV/AIDS day!

From Christen Geiler - 
Sharing good news that the HHS Content Syndication Team won a Federal IT Award! 

Also - There is/was a wikipeida-thon related to Women's History Month NIH was undertaking realted to adding women researchers that are missing from Wikipedia.

From Richard Clark - Good question about Google Plus announcing changes. We'll all keep following it to try to understand the impact. Shawn Humphrey is keeping his ear to the ground on this topic.

From Laura Gray for OASH - 

Hey Tori-I can’t make the call today. But wanted to mention that @opa1 will be live tweeting from Contraceptive Technology Conference March 26-28. If any people on the call connect on SM with providers it would be great if they could share our info by following [Tag:5188278:qfprecs] and [Tag:5188279:ctech15]. Also if anyone has tips on how to live tweet a conference, I would love to hear them. Thanks!

From Rachel - Regarding Live Tweeting! Be sure to use photos! Increase in Live Tweets - photos of presenters and the event work! Also find out in advance if possible twitter accounts for any presenters so you can connect tweets to their followers too. Can use twitter to call for questions for panelists. Have a sign at registration announcing hashtag for the event. Post the hash tag at presentations. If the even is being streamed live, have presenters mention the hashtags.

From Richard - tweeted NIAMS council meeting. concurred that photos with tweets got more engagement.

From Kate - Shared interesting research bits - data and statistics. Also shared short interviews with presenters through a blog.

Would you be willing to speak with me regarding? I am looking for examples of successful implementation of an LCMS within the federal environment.

Thank you for your consideration,

The cuts to the side shot are a bit jarring. I think this is due to using the cut too many times. High frequency cuts are good when the music is up tempo and the content is fast paced. This video and music are much more calm in a sense so it needs more time to engage the viewer to the front shot before moving to a side shot. Will watch again and see if I come up with anything else.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/509598853","","","","2015-03-11T21:52:26.772Z",""

Muybridge demonstrated his zoopraxiscope, an early device for displaying motion pictures. The zoopraxiscope, considered to be the first movie projector, projected images from rotating glass disks in rapid succession to give the impression of motion. The stop-motion images were initially painted onto the glass, as silhouettes. A second series of discs, made in 1892–94, used outline drawings printed onto the discs photographically, then colored by hand. Some of the animated images are very complex, featuring multiple combinations of sequences of animal and human movement.

see attached file sys_kep_where.sas

I suspect the keep statement and not the where statement
is responsible for reducing processing time, at least
when extracting a 10% sample of 3 variables from a big dataset.

This needs more vetting.

My benchmarks indicate equal timings(exactly?) for

set xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx(keep=month member isu where=(mod(member,10)=0));

set xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx(keep=month member isu);
if mod(member,10)=0;

Full benchmark code is below.
Sorry I did not provide data.

This is important for parallel processing because it allows
partitioning of the input data. You CANNOT partition the input
with a where statement and the DOW loop does not work when using a
where statement. The DOW loop DOES support firstobs and
obs in both loops. This is also a big deal?

These two algorithms too exactly 27 seconds (26:51 and 26:88 seconds)
full code is below

Note modulus algorithms is an excellent means of partitioning input.

Experimenting with the new ODS EXCEL Destination

    Special thanks to Chris Hemedinger and Eric Gebhart

  1. Has examples of style elements, inline tags, textdecoration,
     tagattr, rotated headings, data superscripts, data subscripts,
     autofilters, froxen headers, ods text, titles, footnotes,
     heading superscripts and heading subscripts.
  2. Creates two workbooks with one sheet in each workbook.
  3. Shows two methods to add 'DATA' sheets to either workbook.
  4. Has a macro to copy sheets from one workbook to another.
     The sheets can have graphs, data, formulas.. or combinations
     and will be added(cloned) to the second workbook.

Notes: (may not be totally correct - my observations)

  1. Option ""Start_at"" only uses last instance. It messes up other settings(autofilter?)?
     Do not use?
  2. Results are sensitive to location of 'ods text' and 'titles' and 'footnotes'. Put titles and footnotes at top?
  3. Cell with in percentages sort of works but no way to set overall width so percetages are useless?
  4. Absolute_column_width is not needed. Better to use cell_width?
  5. I think SAS is creating a zipped IML file ala newer xlsx files?
  6. tagattr not needed as often because sas formats, inline tags and style statements are honored?
  7. Need to nest {{{}}} to get all inline formatting to be honored.
  8. SAS only supports adding data sheets to an existing workbook?
  9. Macro included that uses powershell to copy a sheet from one workbook
     to another workbook. Really wanted to use R but could not figure out how.
     Python can do it cross platform. Unfortunately I fell back on windows only powershell,
     Afte rall Gates only have about 100 billion dollars.
 10. Because ods excel seems to honor SAS formats, I suspect tagattr may not be as useful.
     Howver it is useful for totating headers. style(header)={tagattr='rotate:45'} - see below
 11. Also if proc report is your preferred reporting tool then user templates may not be needed.

Present at the launch were his crew chief, Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark's assistant professor in the physics department. 

The rocket, which was later dubbed ""Nell"", rose just 41 feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field, but it was an important demonstration that liquid propellants were possible. The launch site is now a National Historic Landmark, the Goddard Rocket Launching Site.

We will give a $5 Starbucks card to the first team member to add 3 posts to the OFPA Yammer Wall on three separate days this week.  But it can’t just be any post!  You need to post a fact each day about Ireland from Wikipedia that is related to some aspect of the type of work OFPA and/or ASPR does in America.  That could be any facts about the government of Ireland’s budget process, medical emergency response programs, disaster & hospital preparedness, vaccination development, etc.  Check out ASPR’s https://www.yammer.com/hhs.gov/uploaded_files/phe.gov for more ideas.  We will announce the winner after they have made their 3rd post!  So check out our FPA Yammer page every day this week and play along!

The questions fall into two general categories, income and health insurance.  I’ll have 3 governmental defined pension plans and SS when I retire – hopefully soon.  Pensions will come from a state government, military service, and federal; I’m currently receiving my state and military retired pay.   I’m hoping there are not any conflicts or penalties associated with drawing the full amount from each source, especially with SS. I’ve paid SS taxes on all forms of income.  My current health insurance is covered by my state pension benefit and Tricare.  Once I hit 65 in a year Medicare will jump in but I’m not sure what the best mix of plans should be to provide maximum coverage for the lowest price.  I do not have FEHB since it is comparatively expensive and the other plan provides the same coverage.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/511846266","","","","2015-03-17T14:34:19.818Z",""

Title:  How Good Workplace Communication Improves Employee Morale
Summary: Communication can instantly start off on the wrong foot when it’s approached negatively rather than positively. When information is transferred insufficiently or inaccurately, workplace productivity goes down. The good news is that the opposite is also true. Good workplace communication can have positive effects on performance including increased productivity, higher employee morale, repeat business, improved employee retention, and a healthier work environment overall.
Date: Thursday, March 19
Time: 12:30 – 1:30 pm
Presenter: James Egbert is a Human Resources Specialist in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Positioned in the Office of the Secretary, Office of Human Resources, James helps to formulate and implement workforce programs and strategies to promote a positive, healthy, and innovative HHS workforce.

They have a Yammer Group and also have just about monthly meetings with different topics. This month the topic is about how to produce a ThunderClap - what is a Thunder Clap you ask? Very briefly it is a tool that allows individuals to sign up their social media accounts that they choose (like FB, Twitter, etc) to make a specific post at a specific time that the Thunderclap organizers provide. It helps get a message out en masse and perhaps have the opportunity to trend.  

Here are the details:

Our next meeting will take place next Tuesday, March 24, 12:30 to 2:00 p.m., and will be a tutorial on launching a Thunderclap. https://www.thunderclap.it/
In a nutshell, a Thunderclap involves getting lots of accounts to send your message to their followers to significantly increase the reach of your messages and people who do not follow you will see it.
 
Our guides will be Brooke Leggin, Office of Women’s Health (Thunderclaps on National Women’s Health Week and National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day), and Kate Perch, who Thunderclapped on behalf of NICHD’s Safe to Sleep anniversary last October: https://www.thunderclap.it/en/projects/17192-safe-sleep-for-baby.
 
Thanks to Audrey Wellons for instigating this topic!!
Please bring your lunch if you’re so inclined.

Let’s start with Drivers. Drivers need to recognize the special safety needs of pedestrians, especially those that are children. Young, elderly, disabled, and intoxicated pedestrians are the most frequent victims in auto-pedestrian collisions. Generally, pedestrians have the right-of-way at all intersections; however, regardless of the rules of the road or right-of-way, drivers are obligated to exercise great care and extreme caution to avoid striking pedestrians.

What can drivers do to safely share the road with pedestrians?
•	Look out for pedestrians.  Don’t engage in distracting behaviors while driving.  You can encounter pedestrians anytime and anywhere. They can be very hard to see - especially in bad weather or at night.  
•	Respect crosswalks.  When entering a crosswalk area be prepared to and drive slowly enough, that you can stop if needed.  Don’t block the crosswalk when stopped at a red light or waiting to make a turn. Doing this will force pedestrians to walk in the drive lane. Stop for pedestrians who are in a crosswalk. 
•	Always watch for children.  Children are the least predictable pedestrians and the most difficult to see. Take extra care to look out for children not only in school zones, but also in residential areas, playgrounds, and parks. 
•	Be extra cautious in school zones.  In a school zone especially when the school zone flashers are blinking, you must slow down and stop to yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within a marked crosswalk or at an intersection with no marked crosswalk.  Always stop when directed to do so by a school crossing guard. 

What can a pedestrian do to prevent pedestrian accidents? 
•	Walk on the sidewalk.  Stay on the sidewalk when available and use crosswalks. Avoid walking in traffic where there are no sidewalks or crosswalks.  If you have to walk on a road that does not have sidewalks, walk facing traffic. 
•	Walk defensively - Be prepared for the unexpected.  Don't let cars surprise you even if a motorist does something wrong like running red light or making a sudden turn. Pay attention while walking along roadways. Just like drivers eliminate distracting behaviors. Keep your eyes and your ears open.
•	Cross streets at intersections whenever possible - Look in all directions before entering the street.  Be especially alert to a vehicle that may be turning right on a red signal. If there are marked crosswalks, use them but do not assume that you are completely safe in a marked crosswalk.  Yes you may have the right of way but making sure of your own safety by looking left, then right, and then left again before you step out into the crosswalk can save you a great deal of pain. Pushing your right to the right of way isn’t worth getting hurt in an accident.
•	Be careful in parking lots - Pedestrians are supposed to have the right-of-way in parking lots too but many drivers don't wait for or even see pedestrians.  Parking lots can be more hazardous than streets.  On streets the direction of traffic is usually predictable but in parking lots vehicles might be moving in all directions, including backwards. 
•	Avoid dangerous moves - Any movement a pedestrian makes that drivers are not expecting could be dangerous.  Don't step into traffic from between parked cars since this is a sure way of surprising drivers. 
•	Keep your view of traffic clear at all times - A pedestrian needs to be able to see vehicles around him.  Don't block your view with packages, umbrellas, or other objects.
 
Drivers, keep your mind on your driving and the traffic around you – including pedestrian traffic.  Pedestrians, remember to make eye contact with drivers to ensure they see you.  Crossing safely is up to both of you!","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/512403984","","","","2015-03-18T14:24:47.819Z",""

In Spring 2015, the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, General Services Administration, and the Department of Health and Human Services will launch a national dialogue and pilot regarding Section 5 of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act), with the goal of identifying approaches to reduce the burden and costs associated with reporting and compliance requirements for grant and contractor communities. 

It is widely acknowledged that those receiving Federal tax dollars via grants, loans, contracts, or sub-awards must navigate a complex, burdensome, and costly process to comply with reporting and other requirements while ensuring quality results are delivered for tax dollars investments. Progress was made following the 2014 National Dialogue on streamlining Federal procurement; this year’s dialogue will build on the innovative ideas collected and expand to meet the requirements of the DATA Act.

The DATA Act Section 5 Pilot Team is soliciting the participation of Federal partners receiving grants and contracts in this important initiative. Participation in the pilot will offer organizations a unique opportunity to guide the future of the government-wide implementation of the DATA Act.

To learn more about the pilot, interested organizations are invited to participate in a webinar with the DATA Act Section 5 Pilot Team on April 1, 2015 from 1:00PM to 2:00PM EDT. DATA Act Section 5 Pilot Grants Lead Lora Kutkat and DATA Act Program Management Office Communications Lead Christopher Zeleznik will lead the discussion, sharing the background and goals of the DATA Act Section 5 Pilot, expected outcomes, and participant opportunities and requirements. There will also be ample time to address any questions you might have about the pilot.

Please register online for this informative and interactive event. In the event that you are unable to attend, a recording and documentation from the event will be posted to the Outreach section of www.grants.gov. Questions regarding the DATA Act Session 5 Pilot Webinar may be directed to Emily Gartland at emily.gartland@gsa.gov.

The participation and engagement of our grant and contractor community partners is essential to the success of this pilot. We greatly look forward to working with you on this important initiative.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/512510275","opengraphobject:351561188382081","","","2015-03-18T17:42:10.517Z",""

---
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH
Women’s History Month is a celebration which had its origins in 1981, when Congress passed Pub. L. 97-28, authorizing and requesting the President proclaim the week beginning March 7, 1982, as “Women’s History Week.”   From 1982 through 1987, Congress continued to pass joint resolutions designating a week in March as “Women’s History Week.”   In 1987, after being petitioned by the National Women’s History Project, Congress passed Pub. L. 100-9, designating March as “Women’s History Month.”  Since 1995, Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama have issued a series of annual proclamations designating the month of March as “Women’s History Month.” The Department of Health and Human Services joins in paying tribute to the generations of women whose individual and collective contributions have helped to shape our world.  The theme for 2015, “Weaving the Stories of Women’s Lives,” presents the opportunity to weave women’s stories into the essential fabric of our nation’s history.  We are also provided an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the myriad ways in which women have contributed to our rich and meaningful past.  During this period of celebration, we recognize the extraordinary accomplishments of women throughout the Department of Health and Human Services who have honored their predecessors by continuing the vital work of ensuring quality health care research, services, and accessibility for all Americans. We are grateful for the strides we have made and the challenges we have overcome.  However, we must continue our efforts to work toward true gender equality by bringing more women into science and health professions and extending opportunities for all to realize their fullest potential in our society.  As we celebrate and remember the women who have blazed trails before us, let us pledge with even greater resolve to continue their legacy.

  Local vs Cloud computing for Power SAS Programmers in a non-transactual environment.

    Clould computing has it place but so do power laptops, workstations and desktops.

    Before you jump on the clould for power programming and development consider the
    Reliability, Seviceability, Availability, Performance and Functionality of the Cloud
    vs a local power laptop, desktop or workstation. I also believe the workstation with
    encryption is a more secure enviroment then the cloud.

    My local system is an off lease Dell T7400 purchased for $600.
    from ebay. I added 2 SSD raid 0 arrays on separate channels. I have 64gb ram and dual quad 3.0ghz
    XEONS(8 cores). This is 2008 technology and unfortunately flash drives are hard to find?

    I also have the SAS scallable performance data environment which supports data patitioning and
    mutiple parallel indexing.

    The cloud computer is  5 Unix boxes 3 with 8 quad cores and 256gb ram for a total of
    96 cores and two Boxes with 4 quad cores for an additiona 32 cores, no hyperthreading.
    All available drives are spinning raid 5 SAN drives. There is no scallable data server software,
    like Netezza, Greenplum or the SAS SDS. Currently the clould
    cannot sort a table over 333gb. I can sort a larger tables on my workstation.
    Intersystem data transfer rate in the cloud is capped at 12gbs?

    Other restrictions on Clould environment. 0.5gb ram per SAS process, max on 12 concurrent SAS processes.
    Down approximately 30 days a year. Does not support a SAS workspace over 1TB and cannot
    sort a table over 333gb. Certain memory intensive summaries run forever in the clould but
    complete in hours on my workstation. Proc distinct when the levels do not fit in memory and
    SAS pages it brains out(0.5gb ram).

    Big Data vs Small data

       The clould shines when accessing big data, defined as ANY SINGLE TABLE OVER A TERABYTE.
       RAID 5 and data backups are also a strong point for clould services with petabytes of data.
       The clould is best as a data server when extracts are processed locally by power programmers.

       But for tables less than a terabyte my old power workstation is at least an
       order of magnitude faster. RAID 0 is ok because the clould has the source data.

       Newer workstations appear to be at least twice as fast as my old T7400.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/513675336","","","","2015-03-20T19:37:28.558Z",""

During my call with Cory today, she encouraged everyone to check out the FDA Innovation Suite which is scheduled to next week at White Oak - Tuesday, March 24th (the 3rd floor of White Oak Building 2).  The FDA Innovation Suite is a combination of several new and exciting initiatives that have been planned and for quite some time. It includes the Innovation Lab, AskIT Now Kiosk, OO Hotel CSU and Cyber Café.  I think there's events going on all next week, so if you'll be in the area, check it out.

Searching File Shares

You can also search files shares for content and information using SharePoint search. To setup file share search, follow these steps:

1. Open SharePoint Central Administration site.

2. Click General Application Settings.

3. Click Farm Search Administration.

4. Click Search Service Application.

5. Click Content Sources under Crawling in the left side menu.

6. Click New Content Source.


7. In Name field, enter FSSearch. In Content Source Type select File Shares. In Start Addresses type the file share that you want to search. In Crawl Settings, you have two options. You can crawl the main folder and all subfolders or you can crawl only the main folder. Choose your preferred option. In Crawl Schedules, click Create Schedule under Full Crawl and setup a schedule. Click OK.

8. On Manage Content Sources  page, right-click FSSearch content source and select Start Full Crawl. It will take some time for the crawling to complete depending on the amount of data in the file share.

9. Once the crawl is complete, go to SharePoint site and create search and search results pages. I will not repeat the steps in this section. Once you have created and configured the search pages, try out the search. Just remember one thing, you have to add contentsource:fssearch in the Query text box in the search results web part. FSSearch is the name of the content source you created in the previous step. By adding this content source in the Query text you limit the results to this content source only. See previous section for details if you have any confusion. You will see results for your searched term on a SharePoint page. This functionality is really useful for companies that hesitate in bringing all data from file shares into SharePoint. Some companies avoid it because of the storage costs and other limitations. SharePoint allows you to search files that are sitting outside SharePoint but still can be indexed and surfaced within SharePoint sites.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/515518395","","","","2015-03-25T18:16:50.479Z","2015-03-25T18:17:06.196Z"

If you have created an external content type and are trying to access it in a list and get Access Denied that is because you have not given permissions to the logged in user to use that external content type.

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):  Improving Proactive Disclosures through Postings on Hot Topics and Greater Collaboration

During 2014, the Department fielded many information requests regarding unaccompanied children entering the United States.  HHS's Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) FOIA Office worked with the agency's Office of Public Affairs, its program office, and the web team to ensure that information on this topic was posted and regularly updated.  ACF maintained a web page where it posted regular updates of information such as where children were released to sponsors, a breakdown by country of origin, copies of forms, a factsheet, and FAQs.  The content of this webpage was chosen based on the nature and number of inquiries received by the FOIA Office and the press office.  The result was a 75% drop in FOIA requests for the information posted.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/515545417","","","","2015-03-25T19:28:54.924Z",""

This message is in

    https://www.yammer.com/hhs.gov/uploaded_files/33108749

There are three ways to fast programming

 1. Point and shoot with mouse actions(fastest)  ie push middle mouse button proc means hi-lited dataset
 2. Point and shoot with the keyboard      ie hit F2 after dataset hi-lite for proc means
 3. Point and shoot with the command line. ie type avgh on command line after hi-liting dataset

This type of 'fast' programming is only supported by the old display manager text editor(not EE) with the simple
clean command line on all windows.
How to map macros to the mouse and keyboard and remember actions to follow,

You need to download  the command macros and include the package.

    utl_perpac.sas

    https://www.yammer.com/hhs.gov/uploaded_files/33108752

Here is what is in the package  (* most used or most critical)

  avgh     proc means last dataset
  cnt      cnt name*sex - last dataset number unique combinations
  cnth     cnt name*sex - hi-lited dataset
  cntv     cnt hilited ariavle last dataset
  con      contents last dataset
  conh     contents hi-lited dataset
 *debugh   macro debug hi-lited
 *dmp      contents with sample data
 *dmph     contents with sample data hi-lited dataset
 *frq      freq sex*age last dataset
 *frqh     freq sex*age hi-lited dataset
  frqv     freq hilited variable last dataset
  iota     column of consecutive integers
 *ls40     40 obs last dataset
 *ls40h    40 obs hi-lited dataset
  lsal     all obs last dataset
  parh     does hi-lited code have matched paraentheses
  proch    syntax for the proc - hi-lite 'proc reg' and get syntax with example
 *prtw     prtw 'sex=""M""' - last dataset subset printed
 *prtwh    prtw 'sex=""M""' - hi-lited dataset subset printed
  sumh     statistics on hi-lited column of numbers
  sumv     statistics on hi-lited variable last dataset
  unv      proc univariate on variable in last dataset
  vu       viewtable last dataset
  vuh      viewtable hi-lited dataset
 *xlsh     view and edit hi-lited dataset in excel (may need a sleep w slow systems)
 *xplo     xplo SUBaSUM put exploded chars in past buffer


Note '?' on the command line retrieves previous commands.

***************************************************************************;

Example 1.  Which line in the macro is causing the error.

 In the macro below variable 'name' is a character but a numeric variaqble is needed.
 However SAS reports the error on the invocation line '%errmke'. We want SAS
 to tell us which line inside the macro is causing the problem.


 %macro errmke(dummy);
     data class;
        set sashelp.class(obs=1);
        if name=2 then sex='M';
     run;quit;
  %mend errmke;

  %errmke;

 If you highlight the macro with invocation and type debugh you will see the following
 in the log. Note SAS has identifies line 1403 columg 4 (position of name varable)
 as the issue.


 1401 +data class;
 1402 +set sashelp.class(obs=1);
 1403 +if name=2 then sex='M';
 ERROR: Character value found where numeric value needed at line 1403 column 4.
 1404 +run;

*****************************************************************************;

Example 2. I would like to view and edit the dataset in excel

  data class;
     set sashelp.class;
  run;quit;

  Highlight class and type xlsh on the command line

This message is at

https://www.yammer.com/hhs.gov/uploaded_files/33353103

 I have posted command macros, function keys and mouse actions for
 a fast development environment

 Below are some other features of the old text editor not available
 in recent Enhanced and Super Enhanced SAS editors.

   Very fast point and shoot editing and code submit in the old text editor.

   suppose you have submit on the right mouse button

   keydef RMB log;clear;out;clear;pgm;submit;home;rec;home;log;z;z;

   Use the ALT key as you hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse
   to select a rectangular block (or column) of te

   After the highlight above hit the right mouse button and the highlighted code will
   be executed.

   Simple actions like typing 860 on the command line will take to line
   860. On long programs I sometimes jot down the location of
   key lines.


   USEFUL EDITIONG COMMANDS
   *************************


  The prefix area  Many of these commands can be put on function keys using a ':', ie :ts.

  D99----  Delete next 99 lines (also could cut with mouse)
  I999---  Insert 999 blank lines useful when autoadd is set
  IB55---  Insert 55 lines before
  C3-----  Copy next three lines to some target
  A000102  Target for line copy or include file (copy after)
  B000102  Target for line copy or include file (copy before)
  M------  Move this line somewhere
  M3-----  Move next 3 lines somewhere
  O3-----  Move source lines over these lines
  R3-----  Replicate the next 3 lines

  DD00103  Block delete   CC00103  Block Copy    MM00103  Block Move
  0000104                 0000104                0000104
  DD-----                 CC-----                MM-----

  OO00103  Target Over    RR3----  Block Replicate
  0000104                 0000104
  OO-----                 RR-----

  (4-----  Shift left first 4 columns into bit bucket (distructive shift)
  )4-----  Shift right first 4 columns (distructive shift)
  >5-----  Nondistructive shift right
  <5-----  Nondistructive shift left
  >>5----  Non distructive shift right of a block of commands
  0000101
  0000102
  >>-----
  <<,)),(( Similar to single character versions
  UC----- Upper case line  - more useful on function key as :UC
  UC26--- Upper case next 26 lines
  LC----- Lower case line
  LC26
  LLC---- Block of lines -lower caSE
  UUC
  TF----- Text flow lines until blank line
  TS----- Text split at cursor better on function key as :tf
  MASK - BUILD TEMPLATE FOR ENTERING DATA

If you’re the kind of person who always speaks up in meetings (guilty as charged), the traditional workplace may work just great for you. But you’re missing out on the perspective and talents of people who like to mull on a problem before contributing, or that of people who communicate better visually or in writing than they do out loud."" On my team we've been looking at different ways of working together, using strength, considering communication styles, and looking at having better - and perhaps less - meetings.  I like the concept that online collaboration isn't supposed to be a substitute to in person or face to face - but rather addresses some needs for communication, collaboration, cooperation and specific types of project work that haven't been met well previously.

Draw Down Restriction is a Term!

Here's Why:  At HRSA, due to the EHB system functionality, DDR is a term on the NoA.  Conditions create a specific due date for required recipient information.  Since HRSA does not dictate when a recipient must make a payment request, a term is placed on the NoA stating the reason for the restriction and providing instruction for submitting a prior approval request when reimbursement is needed.  Therefore,  DDR operates much like a condition of award because the system requires recipients to send in a prior approval request in order to draw down funds.

 If you want all your rtf pages to have the same look and feel in
 both in portrait or landscape then use  cellwidths in percent.

 This also supports ods rtf text statements that fit well
 with your table.

 The example below shows how to line up the decimal point. Even
 works with character data.


 The example also creates a entry for an index or table of contents and
 shows you how to split a prepage container.

 I don't like using tites and footnotes because they interfere with
 MS-Word header and footer space.

I agree that it takes getting used to some silence on a conference call or online meeting when thinking is happening. But  like I said, the better I understand how my colleagues think and work, the more I can adjust my behavior online...and face-to-face as well. 

Listening is a skill we all need to work on and there is something about online meetings that really force you to listen in a way that face-to-face doesn't. And though I agree with Alice that the lack of body language may hinder an introvert, the shield of a computer may also encourage someone to speak up who may not otherwise.

It should be noted that its much easier to have an online meeting when everyone is online instead of a mix of online and face-to-face and I think our group is getting much better about setting those up when they can.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/519368738","","","","2015-04-03T16:58:17.924Z",""

  Each student receives letter grades, A, B, C and D.
  A student does not have to take all the courses.

  any two of the four courses.

  AP - is an A in PloySci
  AG - is an A in Algebra

  DG - is a  D in Algebra

for a clean version of this message:
https://www.yammer.com/hhs.gov/uploaded_files/33631508

This really only works with the old text editor
because durring development a
program can easily be 10,000 lines
and many macros. Only the old text editor can
instantly go to a macro line instantly. You need a prefix area.
Alos EG is just too slow to handle 10,000 lines of code.
EG is like dial up from home?

Whenever I start a new project I create a unique three letter token,
for the Fabulous Fab Detergent Campaign, I might use fab as the token.

fab is then used in all correspondence, all inputs, outputs
temp data...

I generally start out with an initial sas file named

fab_000Drv;

fab_000Drv is what I call the driver program,

Drv is arbitrary

The first section in the fab_000Drv program might be

%macro fab_100GetDat
...
%mend fab_100Get Dat;

all outputs of fab_100GetDat macro would have the names like

fab_100GetDatDem.sas7bdat
fab_100GetDatDem.xls
fab_100GetDatDem.ppt
...

These are self locating files because the directory
where the outputs are stored are in the file name.

fab_100GetDatDem.xls   is stored in c:/fab/xls/
fab_100GetDatDem.ppt   is stored in c:/fab/ppt/

One exception all SAS objects are stored

fab_100GetDatDem.sas7bdat  c:\fab

the next sections might be macros

%macro fab_100GetDat;
...
%macro fab_200SumDat;
...
%macro fan_300Findat;

at the end of the large driver program
would be the real driver

%fab_100GetDat;
%fab_200SumDat;
...
%fan_300Findat;

When I move the project into production I put each
macro in c:\fab\oto and keep just the
driver part in fab_000Drv with extensive header..

I use a very flat filesystem for my projects.
After the project is finished and the project is
readonly, I add descriptions to the folder names
and sometimes move stuff around


I usually just add description.
Sometimes I

ie rename fab to fab_FabulousFabDetergentCampaign_20150630

It also makes me wonder if MY agency is going to bar-code.  I will mention a couple of tiny typos - only because your work is worth it.  Beyond that, aside from the clever use of graphics, before-after, etc. really liked how you came out and said this could be kind of fun - certainly more fun I imagine, than rooting through half-torn cardboard boxes on the 6th set of shelves, 8 feet up and toward the back ;'] for a report that looks sadly like so many many others?  My humble addition re typos (because I used to write/edit for a living);  (1) on 'challenge 2' slide - I think you meant associateD  (2) on 'what people had to say' slide - First quote - Verb tense seems to fluctuate but hey someone else said this so I'd leave it alone too, but please make it 'AN electronic scan' (3) same slide (and keep in mind, I'm not a morning person) - 2nd quote - I didn't quite understand the point being made by the phrase '....many more tools' etc.  Maybe include the rest of that sentence or add a couple of words to clarify.  Beyond that, I was delighted to see you using a bit of 'sell copy' to engage your trainees, for instance, making sure they understand the value of this new tool to begin with. Actually, I spent more time reading this than expected because you made it interesting.

The idea behind this is to give more technically adept beneficiaries (or their caregivers) a way to convert the BlueButton text file in to something that can be imported in to other applications. 

Check out the python code here: 

https://github.com/ekivemark/python-bluebutton 

The code is based on some great work that Alan Viars did a few years ago.

How might this be useful? If you download a BlueButton text file you can convert it to json and then paste that resulting file in to one of a number of online JSON converters. For example if you do a Json to CSV conversion you can then import the resulting file in to Excel and select the columns of data you want to work with.

It's quite difficult for me to recall information that might be more readily available online.

And I think the case can be made to say that being able to find information is more useful now than actually having information. Not that being informed is bad, of course.

Reminder in case you don’t have this on your calendar yet! Today is the HHS Digital Media Round Table Call - where we discuss timely topics, questions, share news and learn from each other’s experience –

Once a month a group of people jump on an old media technology (the telephone) to talk about new media issues (not the telephone). If you have a question or topic that you’d like to throw out to the group, you can send it ahead of time, or just plan on bringing it up yourself. Or just jump in other people’s topics. Or just silently, lurkingly, listen in…

I understand that I need to reconfigure apache's conf file and load the appropriate module, as well as to change some parameters in the 'Sites' directory to run https, but, I am insecure about obtaining a certificate...

Is there someone out there that has done this before that can hold my hand?

I posed this question to our recently retired colleague Janet, who was in FERS. This is what she emailed back to me. ""I got my first interim payment 5.5 weeks after my last work day. When you would get your first payment depends on what day of the month you retire. Since I retired on the last day of January, my pension started on Feb. 1. Don't forget you'll also get your last paycheck, which will include your lump sum for unused annual leave, so that helps tide you over until your pension checks start.
When you retire, you might want to take some time for yourself to adjust and kick back. I seem to have a dread of not having stuff to do, so I signed up for a course and volunteered for several different organizations, on top of the things I'm already doing.

As Yammer users, you get first access to an engaging  3-minute video interview with our outgoing Deputy Secretary, Bill Corr, as part of a new video series called “What’s Your Why.”  This video was made by HHS employees for HHS employees.  Look for more “What’s Your Why” videos coming soon featuring HHS employees from new hires to senior leaders and everyone in between.

SOAPBOX ON
As smart as point and click can be, it will never be as flexible as a program built using Knuth's 7 basic building block instructions. Third and Fourth generation systems like SAS and R form functions from these instructions that simplify programming.

Point and click can get you started, especially if the point and click can produce the background code that the programmer can enhance.  SAS can do this.

Title Medical Risk and Comorbidity Tools for ICD-9-CM Data
Version 1.1
Date 2015-01-04
Description Generates risk estimates and comorbidity flags from ICD-9-CM
codes available in administrative medical datasets. The package supports
the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Elixhauser Comorbidity
classification, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, and the Risk Stratification
Index. Methods are table-based, fast, and use the plyr package, so
parallelization is possible for large jobs. Also includes a sample of
real ICD-9 data for 100 patients from a publicly available dataset.

Was not able to download the code, you may neeed to register?

University of Manitoba (not Winnipeg :)) has some SAS code for ICD9-CM and
ICD10.

SAS will try to pass the where clause to Oracle and Teradata
but only th functions below will work.

This message is also on yammer. I tried something new clicking on attach. Hope the linke id below if not this messsage is
in utl_efficient_DBMS_extracts

I like to use the where clause with the set statement dataset optons.

For inner joins the where clause is always
right after the from clause. The order of clauses is

Some(select) French(from) Women(where) Grow(Group By) Hairy(Having) Oranges(Order By)

as a side note the oder of Keep Rename Where statements is
Kissing Ripe Watermellons

Whenever possible, SAS/ACCESS passes WHERE clauses to the DBMS,
because the DBMS processes them more efficiently than SAS does.

SAS translates the WHERE clauses into generated SQL code.

The performance impact can be particularly significant when you are
accessing large DBMS tables. The following section describes how and
when functions are passed to the DBMS. For information about
passing processing to the DBMS when you are using PROC SQL,
see Overview of Optimizing Your SQL Usage.

If you have NULL values in a DBMS column that is used in a WHERE
clause, be aware th
at your results might differ depending on
whether the WHERE clause is processed in SAS or is passed to
the DBMS for processing. This is because DBMSs tend to remove NULL
values from consideration in a WHERE clause, while SAS does not.

With Oracle, you can EXPLAIN PLAN FOR statement with the query in question
to get the information you want.  DB2 has similar functionality with it's
EXPLAIN statement, as well.

It is very handy to use temporary tables when joining a big
Teradata or Oracle table with a smaller SAS finder table.

Oracle seems to support this construct but not Teradata?

Volatile tables populated from SAS datasets are not
supported well enough by SAS/ACCESS to Teradata to be useful.
If you need to push data to
TD for join purposes, you'll need CREATE TABLE permission
to an actual schema to store
that data, and will need to clean that data up manually yourself.

Well, I have already said more than I know  :-),  but, one more suggestion
before I go silent.  The following post from a few days ago concerned a
similar problem on an Oracle installation.  See:

It seems that temp tables are supported in Oracle

https://listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1502A&L=SAS-L&P=R6557

I believe SYS.V$XXX is a temp table.

select *
   from connection to oracle
     (select * from SYS.V$XXX)
;

Attemps below

Is it possible that you need to specify an owner (or schema) for the
temporary table?

Unfortunately, not even that works for me:

    100    connect to teradata (&td_goo) ;
    101    create table bloob2 as
    102    select * from connection to teradata
    103    (select u.*
    104      from sb_ghri.utilization as u INNER JOIN
    105            my_cohort as c
    106      on    u.mrn = c.mrn)
    107    ;
      82 1738775679 Main 0 SQL
    TERADATA_16: Prepared: on connection 2 83 1738775679 Main 0 SQL
    select u.* from sb_ghri.utilization as u INNER JOIN my_cohort as c
on u.mrn = c.mrn 84
    1738775679 Main 0 SQL
      85 1738775679 Main 0 SQL
    ERROR: Teradata prepare: Object 'my_cohort' does not exist. SQL
statement was: select u.* from
           sb_ghri.utilization as u INNER JOIN my_cohort as c on u.mrn
= c.mrn.
    NOTE: PROC SQL set option NOEXEC and will continue to check the
syntax of statements.

This, despite the fact that I successfully did a (libname-based)
""select * from temp_td.my_cohort"" 2 statements earlier in the same
proc sql block.

Interestingly, if I stick with pass-through the whole way--e.g.:

    execute (CREATE VOLATILE TABLE my_cohort (mrn char(10) ) ON COMMIT
PRESERVE ROWS ) by teradata;
    execute ( COMMIT WORK ) by teradata;
    execute (insert into my_cohort (mrn) values ('roy')) by teradata ;
    create table bloob as
    select * from connection to teradata
    (select u.*
    from sb_ghri.utilization as u INNER JOIN
          my_cohort as c
    on    u.mrn = c.mrn)
    ;

It does work.  But my problem is that my cohort is in a SAS dataset,
and I can't seem to populate a pass-through created volatile dataset","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/522208286","opengraphobject:351561202817589","","","2015-04-10T19:52:32.710Z",""

* Here is an example of applying arbitrary formats to
  a highlighted column of numbers
  in the SAS display manager program window.
  Typing 'fmth dollar18.' on the command will load formatted values
  in paste buffer. This is just plain old basic SAS code.
  No funny catalog entries or the need to export
  and import with the next version of SAS. However we may need to
  convice SAS not to remove advanced legacy functionality
  in the future.

* There are many more changes you could do on the text
  The text does not have to be a single column
  Changes like change roger to mary in signature.

* we have seen in the past how
  debugh -> will identify the line number in a highlighted
  macro, where the error occurred.

  xlsh ->will open a highlighted SAS dataset in excel.

  frqh name*sex -> gives the frequency of highlighted dataset
  in the output window

* These command macros work best in old text editor
  but should work in the enhanced, but not super-enhanced editors, if
  you substitute ""copy"" for ""store"";

* just add these macros to utl_perpac and include the package.

The issue of having to toggle 'ignore blank lines'
to get some legacy support is disappointing.

With all the advances in OO programming you would think
version 5 simple old text editor functionality would
be very inexpensive to maintain.

A better way to create powerpoint slides then ods ppt?

The method I describe below supports

  1. Using you companies theme (not supported by ods ppt)
  2. Programatically inserting and deleting slides (not supported by ods ppt?)

Process short version (you need a pdf version of slidedeck)

  1. Create a pdf slide deck with room for company theme
  2, Insert pdf slides from other presentations
  3. Use free boxoft utility to copy pdf slides to ppt bitmaps
  4. Use VBA macro below to add your companies theme

It seems to me working from a SAS PDF slidedeck is very flexible.

Drawbacks ( I consider most of these to be strengths)

  1. Slides are bitmap images
  2. You have to create a PDF version of slides first(nice to have)
  3. You need to create a template mostly to save
     white area for your company theme, Need to do minimal calculation for space)
  4. You need the free Boxoft pdf to ppt utility
  5. Tou need ghostscript to programatically insert delete PDF slides
  6. Limited ability to make changes to slides in powerpoint
  7. Boxoft seems to use a DDE like process to pump the pdf slides to powerpoint

Here is the process. I think I have posted the pieces
already. I do have a very flexible text slide macro.

  1. Create pdf title slide and a body slise (ods pdf)

  2. Use ghostscript to add a pdf slide
  3. Use boxoft to covert pdf slides to powerpoint bitmaps
  4. Use my VBA macro to add your company theme


/* T806850 Adding your company theme to SAS created PPT slides(via Boxoft)

Win 7 32 bit Powerpoint 2010

Once you have created your slides using ODS PDF and converted them to
a ppt using the free BOXOFT PDF2PPT, you probably want to
add a powerpoint theme. Make sure you used a SAS template that
provides whitespace for the banner and slide number footnote.

If you have a company custom template click on it and
select all the slides, shift first slide then last slide,
Then go to design tab then background slides then apply.
All slides will now have then them behind the SAS foreground
bitmaps.

The following VBA macro will make the SAS bitmaps transparent
and the company theme will appear on each slide.

Note SAS does not provide the ability for a them using
the template. Since SAS titles always appear at the top of a
page you can imbed an image in title1. However I wanted the
company powerpoint theme.

Thanks to the Powerpoint Expert Steve Rindsberg for
the macro below

Sub SetXparency()


Dim oSl As Slide

For Each oSl In ActivePresentation.Slides

    With oSl.Shapes(1)

        With .PictureFormat

            .TransparentBackground = msoTrue

            .TransparencyColor = RGB(255, 255, 255)

        End With

    End With

On March 18th, NTEU testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Operations regarding federal tax compliance of federal workers and contractors. A week later, House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) introduced H.R. 1563, the Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015, which was subsequently marked up by the Committee the next day. House leadership has now announced that the House will vote on H.R. 1563 this Wednesday, April 15th, in recognition of tax day.

Under H.R. 1563, federal agencies would be required to search public records for federal tax liens against employees and job applicants. If a lien is found, the employee or applicant would be asked to consent to the Treasury Department reviewing their tax information and reporting that information back to the agency.

Seriously delinquent tax debt is defined in the bill as “a Federal tax liability that has been assessed by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and may be collected by the Secretary by levy or by a proceeding in court…” Employees found to meet this definition would have to be fired, and applicants could not be hired unless they qualify for an exception, such as innocent spouse, already being on an installment plan or having their salary levied.

There is no dollar minimum or length of time of delinquency included in the definition. Nor is intent or ability to pay given consideration. The bill does allow for a hardship exemption at the discretion of the agency, but no transparency or standards are included. 

Additionally, H.R. 1563 creates an adverse action with penalties including separation for acts of willful failure to file a required federal tax return and willful understatement of federal tax liability. It is unclear how agencies would get access to this level of confidential tax information and how they would determine an employee’s culpability since these matters require expertise on tax laws, which agency labor and human resources personnel do not have.

While NTEU has stated its strong belief that federal employees should satisfy all of their financial obligations, including their federal taxes, we have opposed the bill’s blanket firing policy and have highlighted the current 97% tax compliancy rate of the federal workforce, as tracked by the IRS as of 2013 under the Federal Employee/Retiree Delinquency Initiative that was established in 1993.

Further, NTEU has educated congressional staff about the current processes in place to ensure tax compliance by federal workers (outside of IRS employees, who are already subject to a higher standard), which includes an Office of Government Ethics regulation, under 5 C.F.R., that allows agencies to take disciplinary action against an employee for failure to satisfy just financial obligations, including federal taxes. 

In addition to having the ability to voluntarily establish installment plans with the IRS, federal employees are subject to the Federal Payment Levy Program, which allows the IRS to continuously levy up to 15% of federal salaries to recoup owed taxes. 

NTEU has also underscored the importance of current hardship exemptions recognized by the IRS, which can include relief for innocent and injured spouses and extreme financial situations where the individual does not currently have the ability to pay what is owed.  
            
Attached is a letter NTEU sent to House members, explaining the reasons for our continued opposition to H.R. 1563. On April 15th 2013, a similar bill, H.R. 249, failed to receive the necessary two-thirds majority on the House Suspension Calendar (250 ayes to 159 nays). 

NTEU is working to educate members about the unfair provisions of this bill, and its assault on federal employees’ privacy and tax rights, as well as its implementation challenges for agencies, in hopes that this bill can be defeated again on the House floor.

When I was in my twenties, I was the leader of an alt rock band. We were pretty sure it was only a matter of time before we'd get picked up by a major label because that's how it works, right? Be creative with your friends and you're sure to get paid. Hey, it seemed reasonable back in the 90’s.

For the most part, we were all quiet people; I was known for leaving shows with my gear the moment we’d finished playing, just to avoid awkwardly talking to people I didn’t know. The problem we discovered early on was that if we didn't make some effort to make connections and engage people, we couldn't land more shows. Over time, I made myself figure out how to strike up conversations with strangers and participate in group discussions at parties, back stage, and in other social settings. This was a profoundly difficult process for me, but motivated by a desire to be successful, I worked on hiding my discomfort.

Many years in my new life a writer and web developer came and went. For my professional development, I've been required to develop my social and speaking skills much further. If you put me in a room with smart people, I would say I'm usually able to keep up with what's being said and I'll understand the gist of what's happening. My introvert tendencies may kick in during meetings, so I may focus on taking in information to process later. The problem I frequently run into happens when I'm put on the spot or unexpectedly need to contribute. There are a couple of issues I won’t go into that get in the way of my full participation. One I’ll share- I find myself unable to recall words or ideas that should be accessible to me at those important moments. Too often, I've found that information I knew only moments ago vanishes on me. 

As a communicator, these issues I've listed can be a challenge, one frequently overcome through experience and training. But there’s another way of communicating that, for me, is particularly empowering.
Social media has changed the meeting dynamic for me in important ways. I'm able to control the flow of dialogue in a way that I find far more natural. There's more information to absorb at my own pace and if I want to share an experience or offer an opinion I have the ability to research my thoughts before speaking my mind. For me, that offers far greater confidence as a communicator with introverted tendencies. On social media and Yammer, I can be an informed extrovert and it's perfectly okay with me!

We all know how our colleagues prefer to communicate; some prefer face-to-face, others like the phone or chat, while some people still like email. For me, an organized discussion thread structured and retrievable by topic offers the greatest potential for growth as a communicator.

I hope others can learn from and enjoy this platform and others like it. We're still in what I view to be the infancy of global, social communications. It's an exciting time for folks like myself. We're finally able to say what we've been thinking all along during those long meetings we stayed silent.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/524067419","","","","2015-04-15T16:59:30.409Z",""

LARGE DATASET AND SMALL DATASET SOLUTIONS ARE GIVEN

1. R soluton is one line of code. This splits class
   into dataframes res$F and res$F where res is a list

   res<-split(class, list(class$SEX), drop = TRUE);

2. SAS HASH solution. Like R this is an in memory solution
   good for smaller datasets. First the female records
   are loaded into memory and then sent out to the
   F dataset, then the males areloaded and output.

3. This is a solution for large datasets.
   First we create a macro string containing all
   the levels. Just male and female for outr example.
   The we use a datastep to build the following program.

   Only one line has to changed on the program to do another dataset

   data F M;
      set sashelp.class;
      select (sex);
         when ('F')  output F;

* SMALL DATASET HASH SOLUTION   *
*********************************
*********************************;

* for small datasets this should be a very fast way to split
  a dataset. However the data needs to be indexed or
  sortted on the split variable;

proc sort data=sashelp.class out=class noequals;
by sex;
run;quit;

data _null_;

  * establist the PDV fr both males and females;
  if 0 then set class;

  declare hash h();

    * name is the primary key;
    * if you do not have a primary key you can;
    * use the method below;

    h.definekey('name');
    h.definedata('name','sex','age','height','weight');
    h.definedone();

    * note this is loading the records into memory -
      but can consume memory;
    do until ( last.sex ) ;
      set class;
      by sex ;
      h.add () ;
    end ;

    * output dataset will change with next sex;
    h.output (dataset: sex) ;

run ;quit;

  Thanks Chris. For small unsorted or indexed tables, I think Chris's algorithm is the best.
  You do not need to now the levels of the splitting variable before hand.

  1. Chris has the best solution for small datasets
  2. Use trim instead of strip in my SQL solution (Soren)
  3. R solution that inputs and outputs SAS datasets (need IML)
  4. Updated caliml so SAS macro code can be placed in R(see macro below)


Chris Hemedinger Best Solution for small datasets

%let TABLE=sashelp.cars;
%let COLUMN=origin;

proc sql noprint;
/* build a mini program for each value */
/* create a table with valid chars from data value */
select distinct
   cat(""DATA out_"",compress(&COLUMN.,,'kad'),
   ""; set &TABLE.(where=(&COLUMN.='"", &COLUMN.,
   ""')); run;"") into :allsteps separated by ';'
  from &TABLE.;
quit;

/* macro that includes the program we just generated */
%macro runSteps;
 &allsteps.;
%mend;

/* and...run the macro when ready */
%runSteps;


Thanks Soren

I changed strip to trim

Here is an R solution that creates SAS datasets

As a side note you may want to remove the 'otherwise' from
my select clause, that way you will get an error in the
select clause is not exhaustive?


* here is a partial R solutiuon that outputs
SAS daatsets S1 and S2 for Male and female
too lazy to generlize. I had to put a
resolve function in the caliml macro;

options validvarname=upcase;
data ""c:\temp\class.sas7bdat""(outrep=WINDOWS_32 compress=no);
   set sashelp.class;
run;quit;

%inc ""c:\oto\utl_caliml.sas"";

* R is case sensitive so I like to upcase variable names;
options validvarname=upcase;
data helpclass;
 set sashelp.class;
run;quit;

%macro genr;
   %do i=1 %to 2;
     %str(S&i..saso0&i<-as.data.frame(res[[&i]]);)
   %end;
%mend;

* because there is not write.sas7bdat I had to kludge a little.
* Also becaus of the way the caliml macro is set up;
* I cannot use R 'SAS' macro. ie eval or substitute functons;

%utl_caliml(
  rpg='
   res<-split(helpclass.sasi01, list(helpclass$SEX), drop = TRUE);
   %genr;
  ')
 ;

proc print data=S1;

For federal employees, this is an event we will never forget.

We remember the 168 people—federal workers, members of the public and children—who were killed in an act of rage against our government and against those who proudly serve it. But rather than bow to fear as the attackers intended, the federal community banded together and recommitted itself to public service. 

Every day, you serve your fellow Americans in your offices and laboratories, out in the field and at the borders. You honor the victims of Oklahoma City with your commitment to duty, and we thank you for continuing to perform the important work of our nation.

Today, where the federal building once stood, is the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Each year, millions of visitors pause to reflect at the memorial’s Field of Empty Chairs. Each of the 168 chairs has the name of a victim etched into its glass base, including 19 smaller chairs for the children who perished in the attack. They are poignant reminders of the empty chairs at family dinner tables that can never be filled.

NTEU strives to honor their memories by ending the rhetoric that scapegoats federal employees for the nation’s problems. We honor them by understanding that our country’s greatness comes, in large part, from those who dedicate themselves to its service. 

We will never forget.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/524718793","uploadedfile:34208686","","","2015-04-16T21:41:36.040Z",""

Run C code to do the following (proc Proto)

  1. get the length of a SAS string
  2. first char
  3. last char
  4. ending null char

In Java concatenate two strings 

Using Groovy to get the tota lnumber of
character points for an SAS string
written with and arbitary proportional font

JDBF

Here is what I am working on.
DBASE 7 supports binary IEEE 784 8 byte floats.
These are the floats SAS uses.
I would like to write a java program
to read and write DBASE 7 in both SAS
and R. This should allow R to export
IEEE 8 byte floats and char variables
back and forth to R.
With only base SAS.

quick way to preprocess data.

    I never use the across option in proc
    report because it boxes you in. You cannot

This method will be greatly enhanced when we get 9.4M2 with ‘ods excel’ 
nd again when we get R(inevitable if you do any analytics).
  
You can easily save the workbook to your desk top. 
I suggest you save it as an XLSX file.

If you have this in your autoexec you can run the XML package and many more utilities.

Late last week, budget conferees were selected from the House and Senate.

Today, NTEU National President Colleen Kelley sent a letter to each conferee reiterating that federal employees have already contributed $159 billion in deficit reduction through reduced pay raises and increased retirement contributions. She pointed out that, if Congress continues to use federal employee pay and benefits as a piggy bank, it will become increasingly difficult to recruit or retain federal employees.

The conferees expect to frame an agreement by early May. NTEU will keep us informed of the conference’s activities.

Description Generates risk estimates and comorbidity flags from ICD-9-CM
codes available in administrative medical datasets. The package supports
the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Elixhauser Comorbidity
classification, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, and the Risk Stratification
Index. Methods are table-based, fast, and use the plyr package, so
parallelization is possible for large jobs. Also includes a sample of
real ICD-9 data for 100 patients from a publicly available dataset.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/526854295","opengraphobject:351561203157664","","","2015-04-21T13:30:13.265Z",""

April is National Poetry Month, and an assortment of .gov social media managers are challenging government social media accounts to post a haiku on Tuesday, April 28. 

The idea is to write a haiku that celebrates something about your agency and the great work that it does/has done, while also showcasing the creativity that lies behind .gov social media. Posts could include infographics, links to resources, submissions from staff, haiku as graphic quotes—whatever your imagination can devise (that’s also approved by the right channels, of course)! 

Be sure to use [Tag:5643325:nationalpoetrymonth] in your posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. Submissions from government accounts will be collected after the fact and posted on the National Archives Storify account to bring some attention to your social media accounts, agencies, and government service in general.  
 
No need to advertise publicly, but please share this with government social media managers that may not be on this list. If you have questions or ideas about this event, please send them to me at audrey.wellons@nih.gov.

Most of all, have fun—I'll be excited to see what everyone comes up with!

NTEU alleges the new policy adversely impacts employees with disabilities because it requires them to apply for a reasonable accommodation through the agency’s EEO office in order to request a travel accommodation under the Federal Travel Regulations. This process is administratively burdensome to employees with disabilities, and their accommodation requests are not being processed in a timely manner.  

On April 14, 2015, the Washington, D.C. Regional Director of the FLRA issued a complaint and notice of a hearing requiring the agency to appear and respond to NTEU’s charges. The hearing is scheduled for June 25, 2015, in Washington, D.C.

It has wide usage in fiber-optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than wire cables.

Activity codes are three character alphanumeric codes that HRSA assigns to classify programs by the main type of activity they conduct.  The codes are used in part to distinguish between the wide variety of programs HRSA supports and serve as a tool in programmatic data management in the EHB.

In general, the first letter of an activity code indicates a program activity.  For example, a program code beginning with a U indicates the grant program is a cooperative agreement.  A code that begins with an R indicates research activities, T for training activities and B for a block grant program.  Examples of program activity codes include the H80 Health Center program, R40 MCHB Research Program and T23 Dental Reimbursement program.

Many of today's workplaces and households rely heavily on mobile phones for quick and convenient communication.  It seems that we want instantaneous contact.  You hear it every day, ""There's no way we can do business without mobile phones.""  Chances are there is a mobile phone in your life, used for communicating with the office while you are working in the field or with your children when they arrive home before you in the afternoon.  

As good as mobile phones might be for instant communication, they contribute to bad driving.  It is becoming increasingly clear that talking on a mobile phone distracts a driver from seeing hazards and responding quickly.  
Here are some typical distractions behind the wheel.  Do any of them sound familiar?

• Mobile phone use
• Reading or sending text messages (see Executive Order 13513)
• Trying to eat or drink while making sure nothing spills on you clothing 
• Reaching for a moving object inside the vehicle
• Looking at an object or event outside of the vehicle
• Reading a newspaper, map, or document
• Personal grooming such as applying makeup or shaving
• Focusing on electronic gadgets like the GPS or other devices instead of the road 
• Trying to find a radio station or selecting music on your smart phone 

Here are some reminders for driving safely without distractions:  

• Make sure you, and the workers you supervise, use mobile phones safely.  The safest thing is to make your calls before you set out.  If you receive a mobile phone call while you are driving, let the caller leave a message, pull over, and call that person back.  Reinforce this safety policy by issuing regular reminders and by setting a good example.  
• Be aware that using a hands-free, voice-activated mobile phone also increases driver impairment.  Conference calls while driving and using a hands-free device are still distracting activities. 
• Avoid stressful conversations on the phone or with passengers that can divert the driver's attention from the business of driving. 
• Never read or send text messages while driving.
• Always buckle up. (see Executive Order 13043)
• Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.
• Program your GPS and familiarize yourself with the route before you start driving
• A safe driver also stops before checking maps and addresses, looking at paperwork, and dealing with similar distractions.
• Avoid eating or drinking in the car.  Stop and take a break when you want to eat or drink.  The break will also help to make you more alert.

Don’t let yourself get distracted while driving.  Keep your mind on your driving; keep your eyes on the road, and your hands on the wheel!  Your life and the life of other drivers around you may just depend on it.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/527584221","","","","2015-04-22T18:39:36.358Z",""

as a SAS programmer over an EG server.

The first question to ask is how often do you need to access a database schema where one
or more tables are over 1TB. I define big data as computing problems where most
of a users programming involves tables over 1TB. The other place for a large serves is
massive simulations or parallelism over 64 concurrent jobs. Workstations are available
with 64 cores.

Should I use just the server or a sever plus workstation(or power laptop) for my SAS programming.

Systems like Tableau, Oracle, 
Teradata, Midas and the IDR do not run well on a workstation.

This is how IBM used to measure overall mainframe usability.

  1. Reliability - Do you get the answer you expect.
  2. Availability.
  3. Serviciability
  4. Performance
  5. Functionality
  6. Security

I use either excel or SAS running on both platforms for comparisons.

  1. Reliability.
      There was a bug in SAS 9.3 where 'proc distinct' gave the wrong answer for very high
      cardinality.          Workstation: I downloaded the fix from SAS and installed it on my workstation in 30 minutes
         Server:      Reported it a couple of months ago and it is still not fixed

  2. Availability.
      Workstation: 99.9%
      Server:      75% (Mostly due to the fact that you need an internet connection and because of scheduled
      and non scheduled availability

  3. Serviceability:
      Workstation: I added a second esata III SSD to my laptop in 2 minutes
      Server: Generally not possible

  4. Performance
      Workstation: Much more ram,RAID 0 SSD drives and 100% of the multiple quad XEON processors. Very fast response time
                   not like a server dial-up connection
      Server: Little Ram, SAN spinning raid 5 drives

  5. Functionality
      Workstation: You have an operating system, R, Python, Ghostscript, Perl, C, Java...
                   ODBC(excel access...), more disk space(Try getting 5TB ob the server)...
      Server:      Generally locked down most of the above not available.

  6.  Security
        Workstation: Only have a subset of data. Local and disk encryption.
        Server: Has the jewels so obviously a better targer for hackes.

FYI: I jsut saw a 5TB drive for $150 and flash drives less than $800.

The hardware costs are minimal and R and WPS(sas clone) cost
is reasonable.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/527988357","opengraphobject:351561203242364","","","2015-04-23T13:57:33.886Z",""

By way of background, on June 24, 2014, NTEU filed a national grievance against HHS for failure to fairly and equitably distribute performance awards to bargaining unit employees in the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), in violation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. Unable to settle the grievance, the parties submitted the case to arbitration and a hearing was held before Arbitrator Robert A. Creo on December 11, 2014.

During the hearing, HHS asked to discuss settlement. NTEU crafted and submitted settlement terms that included time off awards for ASPR employees and attorney fees. The parties reached complete agreement on the terms; however, now the agency is refusing to execute the parties’ written settlement agreement.

NTEU alleges that HHS violated 5 U.S.C. § 7116(a)(5) and (8) when it failed to comply with § 7114(b)(5) by failing to execute the written agreement reached in settling the national grievance involving ASPR awards. NTEU further alleges HHS violated the statute by failing to negotiate in good faith and failing to send a duly authorized representative to the negotiations of the settlement agreement.

NTEU has requests that HHS immediately executes the written settlement and comply with its terms; post a notice to all bargaining unit employees indicating that HHS has violated the statute; and any other appropriate remedies.

  I really like data nulls solution for three reasons

    1. You do not need to know the levels of sex before hand.

    2. A format makes the output look nice and the MLF option
       provides a way to get the AllGender counts for free.
       The format is not absolutely required.

    3, The format along with completetypes gives you
       the unknown sex column for free

The puppy was created using a cell from an ear from an adult Afghan hound and involved 123 surrogate mothers, of which only three produced pups (Snuppy being the sole survivor). The team of 45 responsible for cloning Snuppy was led by biomedical scientist Hwang Woo-Suk, who was later found to have lied about his research on previous projects, though independent investigators discovered that Snuppy was a true clone. Snuppy has since been used in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines.

Interesting post in R stackoverflow. User wanted to use hadoop(and 2-3hrs) 

see utl_scoreit_R_wps.txt

SAS scored it in 8.5 seconds on my $600 dell T7400, 
If I have time I will run it on a large EG server.

""but I would still like to score it in about 2-3 hours"" 

As a side note there is no need to materialize the 8 output datasets.
Just use a view. Sometimes it is nice to have the 8 pieces.
Note the colon.

Many SAS programmers consider datasets less than or equal to 1TB are best manipulated with a power workstation?

data alldata/view=alldata;
  set keyscore: ;
run;quit;

Models are almost never built using 100 million observations. Usually a random 1% and similar holdout are used.
In this case R is competitive with SAS.

Base WPS and R would be a cost effective combination for many analytic jobs.

APRIL 25, 1953:  Watson and Crick’s presented their findings on the double helical structure of DNA in the publication Nature. They noted that the structure “suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.” 50 Years later the Human Genome Project had concluded sequencing the genome and published a follow-on in Nature on their vision for genetic research.

I only need a couple of variables crossed with all types.

I only need sums and counts all numeric variables are whole numbers.
I mutiplied monetary values by 100 for accuracy and shorter lengths.

I only need three variables crossed
with the class variables and
no interactionns. ie va1a*varb in the types.
But I need totals for numeric variables.

For efficiency I need to do this in one pass of
the data?

 I am definately using a large cluster of unix servers and the EG SAS
grid.​ This is not a workstation problem.

 I may run 12 parallel jobs on the 300gb datasets since most daatsets are
sorted and indexed on month. Then sum the sums and counts.

 The sort on the nway string(9 classification variables) and summarization
at most granular level seems like  a possible candidate over my single pass
with a view and then proc means.

 Benchmarking will tell me which is faster.

Sort and Summary/Means are multithreaded although judging by fullstimer
they seem to be using a max of 4 threads, maybe a system setting?","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/529510566","","","","2015-04-27T23:56:40.972Z",""

Second reaction...I doubt it's official Gov't but Trello's free and can be quite useful in tracking things that move - it's kind of like being able to have on call a bunch of white boards on which you track whatever topics you want on them - for instance, I'm not intimately familiar with your work but you are - With Trello, you could set up a board maybe for newsletters and then set up topics (which will serve as column heads to what follows) such as ""with first editor,' ''need to find graphics,' etc.  And then UNDER each of those you'd create sort of an electronic index card, for instance, for a 'story on Yammer' which you could easily drag and drop from column to column as you move it from idea to final complete story ready to use.  And THEN on each of those 'cards' - viewable when you click on them - you could add checklists of references, or whatever, other notes, AND color tags for instance to indicate your source or whatever. Nothing top secret, mind you.  I've been using it the last 18 months or so just to keep a sense of higher-level 'stuff' I'm dealing with, gradually needing to use paper lists less though when feeling a bit out of sorts, I still do make those lists sometimes - but now they're shorter and more focused because I can scan my boards for the must-dos..Am using in tandem with OneNote (where mostly I plunk emails, misc. notes that I might need later), since it's on the puter now.  .I'm finding these things helps me keep (some) sanity since we are all often asked to put something down, then pick it up a while later.

The Elektromote was a converted four-wheel landau carriage, equipped with two 2.2 kW electric motors transmitting the power using a chain drive to the rear wheels. It operated from April 29 to June 13, 1882, on a 540 m (591 yard) trail-track using 550 V DC voltage.

NTEU constantly fights to retain annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for federal retirees. Over the years, there have been calls to change the way COLAs are calculated. Some officials have advocated using a so-called “chained CPI,” which assumes that when the price of one item goes up, consumers then switch to a lower cost item to replace it.

The very point of COLAs is to protect pensions against inflation, and the chained CPI would not do that. Read the latest column at NTEU’s retirement issues page.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/530335720","opengraphobject:351561203484555","","","2015-04-29T12:38:54.871Z",""

Roosevelt opening the New York World’s Fair. Programs were transmitted from mobile camera trucks to the main transmitter, which was connected to an aerial atop the Empire State Building. The broadcasting division of RCA was called the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC). It was seen only in New York City and the immediate vicinity, since NBC television had only one station at the time, W2XBS Channel 1, now WNBC Channel 4. The broadcast was seen by an estimated 1,000 viewers from the roughly 200 televisions sets which existed in the New York City area at the time.

Federally Employed Women is an Employee Resource Group that works to end sex and gender discrimination, encourage diversity for inclusion and equality in the workplace and for the advancement of professional growth of women in federal service.

The Parklawn chapter is a very active chapter.  We meet on the third Thursday of each month (except July when we have our National Training Program) and August because people are not usually around.  We have speakers at most of our meetings.  The speakers’ topics vary:  financial planning/retirement, personal development, professional development, workplace issues facing women, and more.  Our chapter is spread out in many Agencies in Montgomery County so we use call in and Adobe Connect so that anyone and everyone can participate.

If you are interested in joining or need more information, please call me at the number below or you can find more information at www.few.org<http://www.few.org>, click on “About Us” or “Join Now.”

Thanks for asking and don’t hesitate to let me know if you need more information.

Legislation to Eliminate Upcoming Tax on Health Insurance Plans

Representative Joe Courtney (D-CT) has introduced H.R. 2050, a bill that would eliminate an excise tax on health insurance plans that is currently scheduled to go into effect in calendar year 2018. Under the Affordable Care Act, a 40 percent tax will be applied to health insurance plans that exceed certain annual limits—$10,200 for those with self-coverage and $27,500 for any type of family coverage (including self plus one). The health plan excise tax was originally scheduled to take effect in 2013, but was delayed by five years over widespread concerns of its impact on health plans and enrollees.

Depending on the exact type of employer-sponsored health insurance, either the health issuer or employer must pay a tax of 40 percent of any dollar amount beyond the annual dollar caps—as an example, if the health plan’s total value exceeds the annual limit by $2,000, then the issuer or the employer must pay a tax of $800. The dollar limits are linked to inflation, and for years 2018 and 2019, are indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus one percent. Starting in 2020, the annual caps are indexed only to the CPI, which rises more slowly than medical inflation.   

While individuals will not be directly taxed, the concern is that employers and issuers will respond to the tax by raising the enrollee share of premiums, and by scaling back plan benefits, as well as increasing deductibles, copays, and other enrollee out-of-pocket costs. 

Additionally, since the excise tax is determined solely by premium cost, and not the quality or actuarial value of a plan’s benefits, it will disproportionately impact plans that cover higher numbers of older individuals, sicker individuals, women, and those living in higher-cost areas and working in high-risk occupations.  

Like other health plans, the FEHBP will not be immune from the excise tax, or from its effects on enrollees. NTEU supports H.R. 2050, and other efforts to stop this tax.

Please visit NTEU’s web site at www.nteu.org to see what you can do.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/531143045","opengraphobject:351561202810302","","","2015-04-30T22:31:53.982Z",""

The House and Senate Budget Conferees issued a Conference Agreement setting an outline for the FY 2016 budget.

The Conference Agreement keeps domestic spending at the insufficient sequestration levels for FY 2016.  As NTEU wrote to Congress earlier this month, these funding levels will make it impossible for federal employees to deliver on their agencies’ missions.

There are no reconciliation instructions to the House Oversight and Senate Governmental Affairs Committees which have jurisdiction over federal benefits such as retirement and FEHBP. That means those committees are not charged with reporting legislation that provides a certain amount of savings by July. Only a handful of committees were given reconciliation instructions, and all are charged with doing it by repealing the Affordable Care Act.

Even though the committees have not been directed by reconciliation to come up with particular savings, they may decide to consider legislation to cut federal employee benefits anyway. Any changes in legislation will have to proceed in regular order and will not have the advantage of expedited passage through reconciliation. NTEU will be watching and prepared to fight any changes.

I will keep you up-to-date on our efforts to hold-harmless federal employee compensation and end sequestration.

NTEU is asking employees to take the survey and respond frankly about the challenges they face.

Between late April and June, OPM will conduct the 2015 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.

The survey asks employees for our views on our jobs, our agency, our managers and senior leaders.

NTEU is urging all of us to take the survey and respond frankly about the impact of inadequate pay raises, budget cuts, training reductions, increased workloads, and management actions on your work life.

I understand that some of us are skeptical about the value of taking the survey. In most of our work units, we have seen little action on many of the critical areas where we have outlined need for change. In some cases when efforts are made to address survey results, front-line employees are not adequately represented on groups. Despite that, I believe it is important that bargaining unit employees take this opportunity to outline the positive and the negative and ensure agencies have the facts from the front line.

Here is why. If there are issues that need to be addressed, we need to keep the pressure on. Management cannot get a pass. We need to keep telling management where the problems are, and if there are improvements year over year, we need to tell them that, too.

Other reasons I encourage you to take the survey include:

• OPM is required by law to administer the survey
• The current administration is encouraging agencies to actively address survey results
• The results are shared with Congress and are often the subject of congressional hearings
• If frontline employees do not complete the survey, the results will be skewed toward management
• The results are used to compile the annual “Best Places to Work” ratings, which attract significant media coverage
• The results can be helpful to NTEU at the bargaining table and will help us in our ongoing work with the agency in Labor-Management Forums.

The survey is voluntary and takes approximately 25 minutes to complete. Questions may be skipped and responses may be saved so you can finish at a later time. Responses are confidential.

Both the language and the system were created by John G. Kemeny, chairman of the Mathematics department, and Professor Thomas Kurtz. They created BASIC so students could write programs to run on the General Electric GE-225 mainframe that was the heart of the system. Ten years later, a version of BASIC written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen was included on the Altair, the first personal computer.

For their next session, the PIC will host Ron Sanders (bio below).  Ron will be discussing his findings from a paper he co-authored “‘I Won’t Back Down?’ Complexity and Courage in Federal Decision-Making."" Good decision-making skills are a fundamental component of successful leadership. Discerning which decisions require the implementation of particular decision-making processes, however, is part of what makes a truly outstanding leader. In his presentation, Ron will discuss what makes a good leader and how they make decisions - especially when facing difficult trade-offs. 

The event will be held on Wednesday, May 6, from 9:30 - 10:30am either at 1800 F Street NW or via phone. RSVP to Melanie.burton@pic.gov for details.

Ron Sander's Bio: A VP and Fellow with the consulting firm Booz Allen, Ron served almost four decades in Federal service, including over two decades in senior human capital positions in the Air Force, DOD (as Director of Civilian Personnel), the IRS (as CHCO), OPM (as Associate Director for Strategy and Policy), and the Intelligence Community (as its CHCO).

Since I am the Newbie to this group I have a ton of questions.  Like is there a program that is effective in getting Veterans on Board?  Not only from the outside but the Inside.   You see  I worked for 13 years in a postition and providing extraordinary accomplishments.  When my boss left and i applied for the job a ""Veterans Certificate"" was issued.. I thanked the Good Lord, thinking I had a chance.. my score was 106, not bad.. but as you know I did not get this position in fact a much less qualified person was selected(or at least in my opinion)  so of course I searched and obtain another position of lesser grade.  
My point is this ... There must be someway to correct the system, Yes there may have been someone better suited for the position, but it should have been a Veteran, any veteran..  So if our certificates have little to no bearing how do we change that.....  I know they are few and far between but if loop holes allow us to be not selected then there is a problem.

Established in 1960, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) is the nation’s largest employer-sponsored health program covering 8.2 million federal employees, retirees, and eligible family members, and provides approximately $48 billion in health care benefits annually. Spending on prescription drugs accounts for approximately 30% of all FEHBP costs—roughly $15 billion annually.

Under current law, FEHBP health plans contract directly with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who operate as middlemen to negotiate prescription drug prices with drug companies and pharmacies on behalf of individual FEHBP plans. While the initial purpose of FEHBP plans contracting with PBMs was to control drug costs; there is little evidence that this has been effective.

Representative Stephen Lynch (D-MA) introduced in the House of Representatives NTEU-supported legislation that would reform FEHBP drug pricing and contracting requirements, resulting in reduced FEHBP costs and lower premiums for enrollees. H.R. 2175, the FEHBP Prescription Drug Oversight & Cost Savings Act, would provide the Office of Personnel Management enhanced oversight and contracting authority to ensure that FEHBP participants are receiving the best possible drug prices. Under the bill, PBMs would be required to return any rebates, incentives, and other price discounts obtained from drug manufacturers to FEHBP, and to adopt new transparency and disclosure policies.

The President’s FY 2016 budget to Congress proposes similar FEHBP PBM contracting reforms, estimated to save $1.5 billion over ten years. Because FEHBP is not permitted to purchase drugs off the Federal Supply Schedule and therefore pays between 15 to 45% more for drugs than other government health care programs currently do (Veterans Administration, Defense, Medicare), NTEU views this legislation as a needed step in the right direction to better control prescription drug spending in FEHBP, and to reduce costs for federal employees and retirees.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/531389999","","","","2015-05-01T14:56:22.116Z",""

The House of Representatives began floor consideration of several annual appropriations bills this week including the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, which funds the Department of Veterans Affairs and many military housing and base facility construction projects.     

Congressman Jody Hice (R-GA) offered an amendment that would eliminate official time at agencies funded under this appropriations bill. While NTEU does not represent any employees at any of these specific agencies, we oppose any legislative effort to abolish or limit the use of official time.  
 
NTEU sent the attached letter to all House members, urging them to vote no on the Hice amendment, and worked with other federal unions to defeat it.  

I am pleased to report that the Hice Amendment failed on the House floor in a bipartisan vote of 190-232. One hundred eighty-three (183) Democratic members (all present) and 49 Republicans joined in voting to reject this anti-labor amendment. It is unclear whether attempts will be made to restrict the use of official time for employees funded by other appropriations bills when they are considered by the House and Senate.

NTEU will continue to oppose any legislative attempts to restrict official time going forward.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/531420829","uploadedfile:35056479","","","2015-05-01T16:23:27.968Z",""

PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK – MAY 3- 9 2015
Before they were famous: Celebrities who were once Federal Workers

During Public Service Recognition Week (May 3 - 9), it's important to think about the proud legacy of America's federal workforce. With the exception of astronauts and the intelligence team that caught Osama bin Laden, there aren't many federal employees whose work is heralded in newspaper headlines, yet they do a million things a day that deserve to be recognized.
Whether it's their role to inspect spinach for traces of salmonella, sound the alarm when a tornado is looming, open new international trade routes for U.S. companies to sell their products, patrol America's borders, care for our veterans or acquire the best equipment for our soldiers, federal employees' satisfaction comes from the knowledge that America is safer and stronger because they did their jobs.
Even though you don't hear about their work every day, that's not to say you've never heard of some of America's federal employees! I guarantee you have. Who are these famous former feds?
Dr. Seuss - Fifteen years before publishing The Cat in the Hat, Theodor Seuss Geisel worked as an illustrator for the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 1942.
Walt Disney - Before changing movies forever, Walt Disney delivered mail to the residents of Chicago, IL.
Walt Whitman - The American poet Walt Whitman was once a writer for the federal government, serving in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Attorney General's office. At the AG's office, Whitman wrote orders to investigate and prosecute a new group called the Ku Klux Klan.
Clara Barton - Before founding the American Red Cross, Clara Barton helped other Americans get their ideas off the ground during her service at the U.S. Patent Office.
Steve Carell - We all know and love Steve Carell for his antics on The Office. Before television, Steve had a different job -- as a letter carrier with the federal government.
Julia Child - During World War II, Julia Child worked as a top secret researcher for the Office of Strategic Services, a U.S. intelligence agency. For her service, she received an award that cited her ""drive and inherent cheerfulness.""
Ina Garten (the Barefoot Contessa) - Another federal worker turned celebrity chef, Ina Garten worked at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as a top economist during the 1970s.
Kal Penn - The rare person who was famous first and then became a federal worker, Kal Penn worked for the Obama administration after starring in roles in the Harold & Kumar movies and television's House.

Quotes
Through my years in government, I have been privileged to know and work with extraordinary men and women…Day in and day out, in a variety of settings and at every level of government, these quiet heroes work to give their fellow citizens the tools and opportunities to make the most of their lives. -President Bill Clinton
Employees who use imagination, initiative and bold vision will be able to benefit in ways that they could never do before. Those who believe in government the most and who dedicate their careers to lives of public service have the greatest stake in making it work. -President Jimmy Carter
Any free government certainly needs a vast corps of well-trained, dedicated, intelligent, long service people who can take care of all the intricate jobs of operating the many and manifold activates that governments these days are compelled to carry on. – President Dwight D. Eisenhower
In the spirit of Public Service Recognition Week, I figured I’d list some thoughts to ponder. Feel free to share your views. Happy Public Service Recognition Week!: The government is us; we are the government, you and I. – President Theodore Roosevelt","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/531444526","","","","2015-05-01T17:54:58.465Z",""

It was so wonderful to meet everyone, although briefly, this week!  I'm so happy to be working with such a great group!  I made it home safely to Denver yesterday and am starting to reflect a little on the program.  I watched a video today on ""Conscious Parenting.""  Although I know it is a little off-topic, I think it hit on some really important concepts of leadership... specifically finding your innner voice and really listening to the authentic inner voices of those around you (both in our families AND at work).  Give the video at least 5 minutes to start gettting into this.  I feel as though this is such an important part of leadership and critical for really knowing, inspiring, and understanding our co-workers.  Would love to hear your thoughts.  Have a wonderful weekend!  Erica

WANT needs to follow an empty dataset template that has
the correct order, length, labels, indexes, sort order...

1. Create empty template dataset class_template with desired order, desired variables,
   labels, lengths, formats, indexes and sort order you want applied to
   class_shuffle.

    proc sql;
       create table class_template (index=(name/unique) sortedby=name) like sashelp.class
    ;quit;

2. Create class_shuffle dataset with extra variables, different lengths, formats, labels and
   no index or sortedby. Index will be created using the empty class_template dataset,

3. Best solution - see below.

   proc append base=class_template force
            data=class_shuffle(keep=_character_ _numeric_);
   run;quit;

I was hoping to eliminate the keep statement but I dont think it is impossible.
SAS seems to do strange and inconsistent processing with empty datasets,

Here is the best solution:

* code to create class_shuffle note different length, format and label;
* also no sortedby or indexes;

data class_shuffle;
  retain pet sex name petname weight age height;
  length sex $32;
  label name=""This label should nto be on the base dataset"";
  set sashelp.class;
  format weight dollar10.2;
  pet='DOG';
  if _n_<9 then petname='ALPHA  ';
  else if _n_<12 then petname='BETA';
  else petname='GAMMA';
run;quit;

* create empty template with index and sortedby;
proc sql;
  create table class_template (index=(name/unique) sortedby=name) like sashelp.class
;quit;

* BEST SOLUTION;
* this works has index and sortedby except you need the keep statement ;
* you do get some warnings;

proc append base=class_template force
            data=class_shuffle;
run;quit;

* SECOND BEST SOLUTION;
* drops variables and reorders;
* you do not need to code both keep and a retain - small savings;
* also you get format, length and label from template;
* Does not have indexes or sorted by;

* in case you need to rerun;
proc sql;
  create table class_template (index=(name/unique) sortedby=name) like sashelp.class
;quit;

data mimic;
  set
    class_template
    class_shuffle(keep=name sex age height weight);

If you need to do additional processing here is another possibility.

It does fix the order, drops unwanted variables and allows for more processing.

However it does not preserve the index, sort order or labels, formats
and lengths defined in the template.

Cinco de Mayo is more of a California Latino tradition then a Mexican one. It was created in the 19th century to celebrate freedom. Today it’s often promoted in the U.S. as an occasion to drink.


History
During the French-Mexican War, a poorly supplied and outnumbered Mexican army under General Ignacio Zaragoza defeats a French army attempting to capture Puebla de Los Angeles, a small town in east-central Mexico. Victory at the Battle of Puebla represented a great moral victory for the Mexican government, symbolizing the country’s ability to defend its sovereignty against threat by a powerful foreign nation.
In 1861, the liberal Mexican Benito Juarez became president of a country in financial ruin, and he was forced to default on his debts to European governments. In response, France, Britain, and Spain sent naval forces to Veracruz to demand reimbursement. Britain and Spain negotiated with Mexico and withdrew, but France, ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use the opportunity to carve a dependent empire out of Mexican territory. Late in 1861, a well-armed French fleet stormed Veracruz, landing a large French force and driving President Juarez and his government into retreat.
Certain that French victory would come swiftly in Mexico, 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez set out to attack Puebla de Los Angeles. From his new headquarters in the north, Juarez rounded up a rag-tag force of loyal men and sent them to Puebla. Led by Texas-born General Zaragoza, the 2,000 Mexicans fortified the town and prepared for the French assault. On the fifth of May, 1862, Lorencez drew his army, well-provisioned and supported by heavy artillery, before the city of Puebla and began their assault from the north. The battle lasted from daybreak to early evening, and when the French finally retreated they had lost nearly 500 soldiers to the fewer than 100 Mexicans killed.
Although not a major strategic victory in the overall war against the French, Zaragoza’s victory at Puebla tightened Mexican resistance, and six years later France withdrew. The same year, Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, who had been installed as emperor of Mexico by Napoleon in 1864, was captured and executed by Juarez’ forces. Puebla de Los Angeles, the site of Zaragoza’s historic victory, was renamed Puebla de Zaragoza in honor of the general. Today, Mexicans celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Puebla as Cinco de Mayo, a national holiday in Mexico.

We have had a liaison in TX reach out for help in WI because the local TX office was having trouble reaching the appropriate local WI official. We connected the state liaisons with each other who helped get local contacts.

Our experience has been that Yammer Networks are most useful when they are used by a pre-existing group that has a common task (planning a meeting, for example) or needs a place to store and access collaborative documents. Yammer has replaced Sharepoint as our go-to for collaborating with outside partners.

We had one experience of trying to build a community from scratch using a Yammer Network (intended to be a discussion forum), and we quickly found out how resource intensive that was. Actually, it really gave us an appreciation for what Sandra and the other managers do!

Now that I and my program staff have a better sense of the most effective uses for Yammer (at least among our employees and partners), I think the impact will be easier to define/measure.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/532428458","","","","2015-05-05T13:56:31.350Z",""

Hello there! I’d like to ask for your help in developing an ideation project (that is launching very soon)! AIDS.gov is seeking public input on ideas/suggestions for the updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy and plans to use UserVoice to do so.

Specifically, I would like to hear your input on the following...  

1) If you have conducted an ideation project (using UserVoice, Ideascale, or similar tool), can you share your content developed for the policy areas -- moderation policies, privacy policies, about this project, and other similar sections? 

2) If you have used UserVoice for an ideation project (seeking ideas from the public on a topic), what was your experience?  What worked well?   How was the support from UserVoice helpful in implementing the tool?

3) Any lessons learned that you can share?

Celebrated since 1985, PSRW has been designated by the president and Congress to honor you—the men and women who serve our nation as government employees and ensure that our government is the best in the world.

NTEU is proud to once again join in the celebration. After all, one of the union’s top priorities is to educate the public about how important federal workers are to the well-being of our country (watch how we do this year-round). With federal employees performing such a wide range of jobs—and often highly-specialized ones—PSRW could be celebrated year-round.

The job responsibilities of the 150,000 NTEU-represented employees at 31 agencies is so exhaustive and far-reaching, it would take weeks to acknowledge all of your accomplishments. You are law enforcement officers, scientists, attorneys and cyber-security experts. You are revenue officers, food inspectors, bank examiners, and the list goes on. Each federal worker plays an important role in keeping the country running and prospering. That’s why the theme of this year’s PSRW celebration—Government Works—is so fitting.

And thanks to you, government still works even in the face of considerable challenges. You’ve been forced to do more with less at work, and you’ve seen relentless attacks on your livelihood. PSRW is a chance to tell your story and show your pride.

This week and year-round, NTEU thanks you for your contributions that we all enjoy and rely on every day.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/532654885","uploadedfile:35234176","","","2015-05-05T22:54:28.329Z",""

Good morning everybody:

Last week our 2013 DEHS Annual Report was published. We only ordered 50 copies so we could minimize waste but still have hard copies available for some of our stakeholders. Hard copies were hand-delivered to DEHS Directors in our Director Meeting last week in Oklahoma City and mailed to OEHE and Area Directors.  The PDF version of the report is now available on the DEHS website under the “Featured” section on the right-hand side.  Please feel free to print and distribute as many as you want.

Our 2014 Annual Report is already going through the publication process so it won’t be long before we are finally caught up.  

If you have any ideas for improving our Annual Report, please let me know.  Enjoy reading about the great environmental health work everybody is doing across the country.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/532949418","opengraphobject:348842974319875","","","2015-05-06T13:59:13.564Z",""

Persistent. Common Good-Focused. Willing Deviation from the Norm.

These are characteristics of a successful government innovator identified by a pool of respondents in a 2015 Government Business Council report. Why is Innovation critical to the future success of federal agencies? The report found that Innovation is necessary within federal agencies to offset tighter budgets and prevent deviation from mission goals.

So what’s hindering Innovation in federal agencies? Leadership. Sixty percent of federal employees cite lack of leadership within their agency as the main deterrence in adopting new ideas. This viewcast will provide you with the tools to become a successful federal Innovator by focusing on:

Inhibitors of Innovation and how to overcome Best Practices of Innovation to cultivate creativity Culture and Leadership of Innovation and how it can either help or hinder Structure of Innovation to ensure new ideas thrive

Panel Includes:
Dan Doney, Chief Innovation Officer, Defense Intelligence Agency Barbara Lopresti, Chief of the Technologies Management Office, Census Bureau Roger Baker, Former Assistant Secretary and CIO, Veterans Affairs Tim Hoechst, Chief Technology Officer, Agilex Technologies

I hope your week is going well. I just wanted to touch base and see how you were doing with regards to MLDP work. I have been looking though the Passport to Health packet and have even come up with three health goals. I think I will type them up nicely and then post them in my office and at home as motivation. What tips do you have for keeping track with your goals?

Don't feel pressured to share your goals, but I will share mine! Health and fitness is a real passion of mine, and I am always open to discuss ways to get and stay well!

My goals:

1. Run at least 10 miles a week most weeks, and between 15-20 miles a week when training for a half-marathon (I have halfs scheduled for September and November).

2. Go to bed by 11 pm so that I can get up by 5 am during the week for morning workouts.

3. Keep the kitchen stocked with healthy food (fruit, veggies, healthy dips, lean protein) so that I don't feel ""compelled"" to binge on junk.

I think that if I can commit to these goals, I will go a long way to staying healthy.

Hold me accountable please!

Take care,

Monica

I can tell you from my experience, with the Council and other programs of the HHS IDEA Lab, the support and recognition we give our colleagues through voting and spreading the word about this program is tremendously valuable.  It does not take long at all and there is a good chance you will learn something new and interesting to you. 

Voting is open to all HHS employees until May 15. You can cast your vote here.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/533142024","","","","2015-05-06T21:57:23.612Z",""

I am a trained research methodologist so I can advise on a research project from conception through analysis and presentation. This includes quantitative methods as well as qualitative (focus groups, interviews, observation etc). 

I can also advise on more advanced qualitative methods that include ""time and memory; space, place and mobile methods; digital research and online environments; and using visual, audio and other sensory data.""

So anyway I would be happy to help and keep my skills fresh.

The user inputs key assumptions about longevity, rates of return, inflation, changing standards of living over time, desired estate, replacement of cars, change of home, etc. etc. The package I've used for nine years is called ESPlanner (about $150, with a basic version free online). It was developed by Boston Univ. economist and retirement planning expert Lawrence Kotlikoff. 

I have no financial interest in Kotlikoff's product, but year in and year out, I have found ESPlanner to be an essential tool for addressing the knotty calculations this article struggles to grapple with. If you're comfortable with financial matters, you can run it yourself, and you'll develop a deep understanding of the multiple choices and variables that are driving your retirement lifestyle. Otherwise, find one of the many financial planners who have integrated ESPlanner into their practice.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/534717798","","","","2015-05-11T12:09:45.935Z",""

That is the million dollar question. In my experience, I was better able to handle the situation when its someone I do not have a relationship with or who is a close colleague. I feel very comfortable calling, emailing or speaking with the individual in person to give a gentle push or inquire why they have missed the deadline. In the past, when this happened to someone I felt close too, I took it personally and was very disappointed.  I felt since this person was a friend, my request should have been a priority. I quickly realized that was not the case in our work environment and many people have competing prioties. With this awareness about myself, I had to de-personalize things and treat every situation the same. This means gentle pushes for everyone, and maybe some not-so-gentle pushes for people I am closer too- if I can get away with it. 
I'm very interested to read about other experiences.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/534726290","","","","2015-05-11T12:28:49.030Z",""

Sometimes things just slip through the cracks and getting a reminder will help.  Usually when I miss a deadline its because too many things are happening at one time.  I think a couple pointers:  
1.  Always be kind and objective in your communication.  If you are annoyed or have pre-judeged why someone was late with a deadline, it may show in your communication.
2.  Especially as a supervisor, you need to be consistent.  If one week, you are sending reminders and then you let deadlines pass the next week, its hard for the people you supervise to be consistent.
3.  Not everyone uses the same technology to communictate.  Some people like phone, some email, and some face-to-face contact.  If you have tried one modality and it did not work, try a different one.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/534731804","","","","2015-05-11T12:41:03.676Z",""

I can’t tell you how many applications there are exactly, but I am guessing about a hundred or so.  Some are removed from consideration because they don’t meet the basic criteria--they didn’t fill out the application correctly, that sort of thing.  The rest are divided and reviewed by past winners.  I defer to Elizabeth Kittrie as to how soon she gets back to people with rejected applications and to those whose applications are moving forward for consideration.   I hope you apply sometime in the near future as it is a tremendous experience.

I’ve experienced this scenario and have learned that different strategies work and motivate people differently. One strategy that worked effectively for me with a person in a “senior” position that missed a deadline for a workgroup assignment was that I sent them a follow-up Outlook calendar appointment after they’d missed their deadline to establish a 1-1 working meeting to facilitate their completing the time-sensitive task.  Since this person was in a “senior” position and had a full schedule I had to be flexible and conduct the follow-up appointment via Lync since we were both working remotely and the task needed to get done. We used the Lync screen share and call functions so I could provide this person real-time support to help them complete their assignment.  I learned this person had many questions that had delayed their finishing the assignment in the first place, but didn’t have time to reach out for support and this had ultimately been the cause of their missed deadline. Using collaboration technology, such as Lync, and being flexible, especially with a person in a “senior” position, helped me help this person get their task completed.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/534852258","","","","2015-05-11T16:51:20.591Z",""

* This does not require IML.
* Just need one libname in SAS.
* Need to figure out XMLDouble?;

Note R can be installed without ADMIN previledges.
Macros are below.

* There are at least three issues with this method.;

 1. It should only be used with small datasets
    because it is very slow. (less than 100mb?) and
    it creates large XML files.

 2. There is no typing so a column that is character
    with valid numeric variables will be returned as
    a number. My testing indicates type will be changed
    if a non numeric character is found, even at depth of
    100,000.

 3. There is some loss of precision because I could not get
    XMLDouble to work. Note this should solve #2 above.

Topic: Agile, Hybrid projects and Risk Management
Speaker: Mark Tolbert, PMP; Best Practices Team, LLC.

Overview:  The presentation will cover a number of reasons why organizations today need to be up-to-date with Agile methodologies. No one process or methodology fits all situations: Agile is not a panacea for all projects. The speaker will discuss what types of projects are best suited for a more traditional project management approach. Most projects today really require a “hybrid” approach, and many “Agile projects” do evolve into “hybrid projects,” and the key people involved in project management – (the scrum master and product owner) – will also need to be well versed in Agile, as well as traditional project management methods. Since Risk management is a key part of successful project management the presentation will also explore how Agile methodologies provide different approaches for protecting the project from uncertainty than do the traditional methods.

  1. Save the macro you want to run multiple times in parallel in your autocall folder.
  2. Create a macro variable with your customised  sas invocation. Put the macro var in autoexec. see below
  3. Use null files for sysin and log in customised sas invocation, use termstmt and altlog instead.
     This allows you to run your driver or any macro multiple times with different arguments.
     Note you can test the macro by running it interactively without systask.
  4. Use simplified systask command to invoke macro(driver?) multiple times
     with different arguments.
     You only have to edit one line to run other macros in parallel.

     Note SAS recognizes the macro arguments, no need for -sysparm or -set
     just substitute another macro and run it multiple times.
     This is all you have to change.

Dvorak and Dealey's objective was to scientifically design a keyboard to decrease typing errors, speed up typing, and lessen typist fatigue. They engaged in extensive research while designing their keyboard layout. In 1914 and 1915,Dealey attended seminars on the science of motion and later reviewed slow-motion films of typists with Dvorak. Dvorak and Dealey meticulously studied the English language, researching the most used letters and letter combinations. They also studied the physiology of the hand. The result in 1932 was the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard. While widely recognized as superior to the QWERTY layout, the Dvorak keyboard is not widely used.

BPA (FAR 8.405-3)
-fill repetitive needs for supplies or services
-requested services are of a very specific nature
-may not require SOW.
-BPA is NOT a contract

IDIQ (FAR 16.5)
-applies to specific areas of support, but not definitive
-vendors have a minimum and maximum order amount
-require SOW. and requirements must align with IDIQ scope
-contracts are issued as Task Orders (non-construction) or Job Orders (construction)

These are just some key points, but there is much more to it.  I would recommend reading the identified sections in the FAR for the definitive explanation.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/535270636","","","","2015-05-12T12:22:58.664Z",""

Help Others in Your Community With an MA in Counseling

The field of clinical mental health counseling is growing each year, presenting many exciting opportunities for individuals interested in a career in human services.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 2012 and 2022, employment of mental health counselors will grow by approximately 29 percent.	 
 

This expansion will result in approximately 165,100 jobs for counselors. 
This job growth can be attributed to recent changes in health care regulations, which mandate that insurance companies cover mental health issues the same as they would other chronic diseases.
 
 
Therefore, mental health centers, treatment, and counseling facilities will need to hire more counselors to meet this demand.
Counseling@Northwestern, the Master of Arts in Counseling Program delivered online from The Family Institute at Northwestern University, will prepare you to provide the highest quality mental health services to those in need as a clinical mental health counselor.

Through comprehensive clinical training and weekly meetings with a dedicated group supervisor, you will develop an in-depth understanding of the psychodynamic perspective and effectively use this advanced model to help individuals and families lead stronger, healthier lives.
This message has been generously sponsored by Northwestern University.

If I am not familiar with a colleague who committed to a task, and did not follow through by the deadline-I kindly, reply to the email (if one exists) that states the colleague's commitment to their responsibility, and ask when I can expect their deliverable, task, etc. As Amelia mentioned, a colleague with whom I have a better working relationship with, I would take a more informal approach; this could be via a chat in the hall or a quick phone call. If after follow up., I have still received no feedback or response to the task, if I am in the capacity to complete the task on my own, I will opt to do this to avoid further conflict.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/535392347","","","","2015-05-12T16:25:03.173Z",""

"" The model proposed by Prof Laurence Kotlikoff at Boston University takes into account that spending is not uniform in retirement. His models do ""smoothing"" of withdrawls over short periods of time, and calculate the impact on long term asset preservation. The models use a technique known as ""dynamic programming"" (used in engineering) in addition to monte-carlo simulation of market returns to update the spending plan every year. Early in retirement you may still have a mortgage so your spending may decline in later years. In later years medical costs will increase.

My analogy is that I need a place to live.  So, I can rent or I can buy.  If I buy, I ""own"" the place, if I rent the landlord does but both result in a place to live.  The kinds of things I need to think through to make a decision include: how much money I have, how long I plan to stay, the kind of place I can afford with each choice (and that alone probably requires a lot of decisions about trade offs), what is available where I want to live and expected ROI.  

So, it appears to me that either an IDIQ or a MAS BPA will give me a group of vendors from which to compete individual task orders (a place to live). What are the business needs that each choice addresses?  For example, what should make me care that one is a contract and the other isn't?  How big of a deal is it that IDIQ TOs cannot be competed?  What are the issues with determining the min and the max?  How does vehicle set up differ?  (I am getting the sense that an IDIQ takes more work to set up, less to maintain).  Our systems can't handle different line items for a BPA so that impacts the administration costs.  What are the costs/benefits of going through FedBizOpps vs. selecting a number of vendors from the FSS and requesting they respond?

Another set of questions exist around potential vendors.  Does the choice of vehicle impact who responds? 

I hope this helps clarify my question.

Under existing OMB policy, agency uses of general or undifferentiated “suggestion boxes” are not covered by the PRA. Similarly, an agency does not trigger the PRA’s requirements when it posts its email address or uses an application for brainstorming or idea-generating on its website to enable the public to submit feedback. However, if an agency requests information from respondents beyond name and email or mailing address (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, employment, or citizenship status), this request is covered by the PRA because it seeks information beyond what is “necessary” for self-identification of the respondent. 
If an agency asks the public to respond to a series of specific questions or a series of specific prompts that gather information (e.g., for purposes of aggregation or survey) about whether, for example, a particular program is or is not effective, the collection of information is subject to the PRA. However, the PRA does not apply to posts that allow members of the public to provide general or unstructured feedback about a program (such as a standard Federal Register notice, a request for comments on a report or proposed initiative, or a request for ideas, comments, suggestions, or anything else that might improve the program).""  

Thus, I believe that the intent of AIDS.gov to seek public input on ideas/suggestions for the updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy is in line with current regulations and practices.  

In fact many government agencies are encouraged to reach out to the public using Ideation platforms like ""UserVoice"" to get ideas and suggestions for their programs and strategic plans.

Ignore if you do not use the old text editor. The one

see for clean version

* suppose you have formula below in the old text program
  editor.

  2*constant('PI')**2

  If you highlight the formula and type
  'evl' on the old editor clean command line.
  Or highlight and hit cntl-e

  You will see this in the log
  RESULT=19.739208802

  note if you use sysevalf you would need to remove
  the quotes, add sysevalf and sysfunc. This
  destroys the text. Reverse changes to get text back.

  %put result=%sysevalf(2*%sysfunc(constant(PI))**2);

  result=19.7392088021786

  You could eliminate typing evl by placing

  store;note;notesubmit '%evla';

  on a cntl-e function key

Note SAS removed the 'store' command from the enhanced editor a long time ago. Others are gone or do not work well recently.

Build yourself a dictionary of TLAs(triple letter
acronyms) and use when appropriate.. This will
make your programs more understandable by you and others.
Allow many exceptions where appropriate.

Also think Kingdom, Phylum, Class and Order hierarchy.

Suppose you have six blood pressure measuements

BpdSit     diastolic sitting
BpdLay     diastolic Supine
BpdTal     diastolic Standing

BpsSit     systolic sitting
BpsLay
BpsTal

If you do this the ':' operator and arrays are your friend.

Now suppose you want some averages

  mean(of bpd:) Diastolic mean
  mean(of bps:) Systolic  mean

  mean(of bp:)  Overall mean

/* why say the same thing six different ways note Aev instead of ae */
/* Three letter boundaries are also your frien.

AESPDT         AevDteEnd
AESTPDT        AevDteEnd
AEEND          AevDteEnd
AEENDT         AevDteEnd
AEENDATE       AevDteEnd
AEFINALDT      AevDteEnd

I use dataset prefixes

proc sort data=TrtAll out=TrtAllSrt; * note Srt for sort

proc transpose data=TrtAll out=TrtAllXpo; * note Xpo for transpose;

data TrtAllNrm; * Note nrm for normalize;
  array trt[*]  Trt:;
  array yer[2010:2015] yr1-yr15;
  array val[6]  salary1-salary3;
  array nam[6]  ('Doctor' 'Nurse', 'PA');
  set TrtFat;
  do i= to 3;
    hsp_salary=val[i];
    hsp_occupation=nam[i];
    output;
  end;
  keep hsp_:;
run;quit;

data TrtNrmRpt * dataset for a report;

data TrtNrmFin * final dataset;

Now suppose you want to delete all the Trt datasets in work

proc datasets;
  delete Trt:;
run;quit;

* input the Trt Datasets;
data TrtAddDsn;
  set Trt: indsname=dsn;;
  datasetname=dsn;
run;quit;

Other uses of colon with hierarchies

* names that start with J;
proc print data=sashelp.class(where=( name =: 'J'));
run;quit;

There are letters in english that sound the same. These are useful for
   building unique TLAs

     y and i
     d and e, t, z, v and p

     there are many combinations of letters that can be replaced with
     one letter ie zro and zero

The Agency receives between 15-25 a year.  An unsolicited request for funding is a written proposal generated solely on an organization’s own initiative and not in response to any formal solicitation by HRSA or an informal solicitation by HRSA staff.  If you receive one, send it to the DGP General Box: DGP@hrsa.gov. You do not need to review the proposal at this time; simply send it to DGP upon receipt, without action.

DGP will immediately conduct a preliminary screening to determine if it falls within HRSA’s mission, and if it does, determine the potential award instrument.  DGP will then route it to the appropriate program office for a formal determination to be made on whether or not it should be considered for funding.  Because an unsolicited proposal is a form of single-source award and an exception to maximum competition, the controlled process will ensure that such exceptions are limited.  For an unsolicited request to be considered for funding it must, at a minimum, be for a project that 1) is truly unsolicited; 2) falls within HRSA’s mission; and 3) is not within the scope of any current, pending or planned funding opportunity.  In cases where the three criteria above are met, funds are available, and the PO pursues a single-source award for the unsolicited request for funding, the PO must seek their Associate Administrator and follow all governing policies and procedure for requesting a single-source award as delineated GPAM Chapter 502.4.5.

If your program is not going to pursue funding the unsolicited proposal, simply respond to DGP within the time specified and DGP will prepare a response to the requester.

For more information visit the HRSA SOP on Unsolicited Proposals.

Water was manually fetched daily from street corner pumps, while waste was shoveled monthly out of basements into tanks on horse-drawn carts - a situation ripe for spread of disease. In 1854, at the height of one of three great cholera epidemics that claimed 50,000-70,000 lives each time, the medical establishment blamed cholera on “miasma” (meaning ""something in the air"") and on the working class's over-consumption of gin (gin parlors being the marijuana dispensaries of their day). One independent medical thinker, Dr. John Snow, thought otherwise: he mapped cholera deaths in Soho with a street bar-chart, and related house-level mortality rates to distance from the Broad Street public water pump. His use of real data proved the water-borne nature of the disease's transmission, led to the pump being closed, and ushered in the era of great Victorian urban public health improvements.

In America today,the federal government is the world's largest collector of data, but probably does little with the majority of it. We can use today’s “Big Data” approaches to extract value from health data for systems and decisions that ultimately affect the health and well-being of millions of Americans. Yet we still need to overcome several barriers: (1) The mystification and hyping of Big Data. (2) The lack of new Big Statistics with which to investigate Big Data. (3) The tendency to rush to display just because we can, rather than in response to a critical business need or question. (4) The need for intelligent interpretation of results to senior executives who may not instinctively think analytically. So if you think you can help out with any of these challenges, you are welcome and PLEASE DO! Record your experiences, victories, setbacks, and questions here for the benefit of your fellow data warriors facing similar issues in other divisions.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/536445807","","","","2015-05-14T16:17:48.681Z",""

   * METHOD WITH BELLS AND WHISTLES

    Note there is not data for the unknown column but
    we still have it

    1. You do not need to know the levels of sex before hand.

    2. A format makes the output look nice and the MLF option
       provides a way to get the AllGender counts and
       missing unknown sex for free.
       The format is not absolutely required.

    3, The format along with completetypes gives you
       the unknown sex column for free

Community health centers (CHCs) are uniquely positioned to be an important partner for hospital systems as healthcare delivery systems seek out new methods to improve health outcomes. It is imperative for hospitals and health centers to understand how to form collaborations, the role they should play in these collaborations and what is needed to maximize the benefits of collaborating with federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to create integrated delivery models of care that provide a coordinated continuum of services to targeted patient populations.

In YRDIF calculations that use the ACT/ACT basis, both a 365–day year and 366–day year are taken into account.
For example, if n365 equals the number of days between the start and end dates in a 365–day year, and n366
equals the number of days between the start and end dates in a 366–day year, the YRDIF calculation is computed
as YRDIF=n365/365.0 + n366/366.0. This calculation corresponds to the commonly understood ACT/ACT day count
basis that is documented in the financial literature.
The values for basis also includes 30/360, ACT/360, and ACT/365. Each has well-defined meanings that must be
adhered to in calculating interest payments for specific financial instruments.

There are some great suggestions out there!  I just wanted to add another perspective.  As much as possible, I think it's best to set people up for success.  For example, when leading a team or even just taking notes at a meeting, I try to end each meeting or session with an action item list with a deadline and a name next to each item.  When the expectation is public, people are more inclined to follow through.  Especially when they need to report out on their progress at the next meeting.  If they've missed a deadline, I agree with the other responses, a friendly reminder along with a ""status update"" request (and attaching a copy of the original action item list) is usually helpful.  People have all kinds of reasons for missing deadlines, so it's best to always give them the benefit of the doubt.  If they are non responsive after several attempts, I might cc their boss or if they are senior, go to my boss for a suggestion (she will often reach out on my behalf).","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/537024653","","","","2015-05-15T19:47:18.952Z",""

MAY 16, 1960: Physicist Theodore Maiman, while, working at the Hughes Research Laboratories of the Hughes Aircraft company in Malibu, California, used an artificial ruby to create the first working laser. That achievement earned him the moniker “father of the electro-optics industry.” Maiman succeeded in producing a short burst of coherent light from his humble device – not a continuous concentrated beam of light, and far less powerful than many lasers today, but nonetheless, it was a working laser.

http://ethw.org/images/2/2a/Maiman1.jpg 


MAY 17, 1943: The U.S. Army signed a contract with the University of Pennsylvania’s Moore School of Electrical Engineering to develop a computer for its Ballistics Research Library. Known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), its creation marked a major step in modern computing. Calculations that once took mathematicians three months to perform could now be completed in mere seconds.

For those among you who are open data enthusiasts and visionaries...

The HHS Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD) project is seeking an “Open Data Evangelist” detailee to take this initiative to the next level.  

DDOD reimagines the way HHS agencies (including CMS, FDA, NIH, CDC, AHRQ, ACF and others) deliver value with open data, in the process maximizing economic and public health impact.  At its core, DDOD is a framework of tools and methods to provide a systematic, ongoing and transparent mechanism for industry and researchers to tell HHS what data they need in the form of “use cases”.  With DDOD, open data efforts are managed in terms of ""use cases"", enabling better allocation of limited resources and ensuring that each release has real and immediate value.  

As Evangelist, you’ll have an opportunity to closely interact with program owners across HHS’s 11 agencies in order to execute on the DDOD use cases.  Your duties will include:
  •   Plan out and manage each use case as an independent project, while looking for efficiencies to improve DDOD scalability.  
  •   Give presentations on the benefits and logistics around DDOD to wide audiences in an effort to built the brand, gain support from program owners and generate new use cases from user communities.
  •   Work with external organizations to understand their requests, set up collaborations on solution implementations, and ensure their needs are being addressed.  
  •   Work with program owners to find incentives for them to actively participate in DDOD, ensure they understand how to work through their use case, and help them arrange collaborations with data requesters.
  •   Document solutions identified in DDOD’s public knowledge base -- both short term workarounds and long term implementations.
  •   Make arrangements for systems implementation, data hosting, additional indexing on HealthData.gov, and validation testing.  

You’ll work out of the HHS IDEA Lab for a period of 6-12 months.  This is an ideal opportunity for an individual with a desire and ability to quickly learn topics in the areas of healthcare and social services.  You’ll return to your home agency with a deeper understanding of processes for leveraging data assets, as well as the experience in working across many agencies to maximize the value of these assets.

Logistics:
  •   Location of detail: HHS IDEA Lab offices (Washington, DC), with telecommute possible
  •   Duration: 6-12 months, but negotiable
  •   Reimbursement: Would need to come from offering agency
  •   Applying: Contact me by June 30 indicating your interest.  Feel free to review the project website at http://ddod.us and contact me with questions.

1. OEDA SASAUTOS tools are unavailable and options SASAUTOS does not enable it?

2. Users cannot set up there own autocall libraries?

FYI:

It looks like the CCW has gone the the virtualization root, I am not fan of virtualization  for two reasons:

1. Virtualization is always slower than native processing, especially for users who understand the differences in loosely coupled boxes(12gbs between boxes). Although the degradation can be quite small.

2. Understanding how close the data is the the boxes can be very handy. Although single RAID 5 SANs are not  bad for read dominant processing. Not sure what really happens with a mix of intel and sun hardware. Hope to do some benchmarks.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/537663531","","","","2015-05-18T17:36:06.876Z",""

It looks like x86 Linux 64 is running in virtual boxes. However I cannot get down to the hardware layer to see the physical servers. I suspect they may be combination of Sun  unix and Intel boxes?

There appear to be 8 hosts each with 24 virtual CPUs and 256gb of ram each? Not sure.  Prior to the upgrade I believe there were 5 Sun boxes 3 with 32 CPUs  and 256gb ram and 2 with 16 CPUs and 128gb ram.

So we now have 192 single threaded CPUs and much more ram, ie 2TB? Not sure because of virtualization.
Prior tot he upgrade we had 138 CPUs and 1Tb of ram.

We lose a little with the virtualization but gain much more with ram and CPUs.

Hope to examine th eI/O and some benchmarks.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/537710335","","","","2015-05-18T19:54:28.143Z",""

** - only 2gb memory in EG (22gb dataset)
*  - parallel indexing and partioned data not supported in EG
     DPDE is free in workstation SAS

*** Grid is not working for me after upgrade.



Note only 10 grided jobs are allowed by my EG grid manager. A Workstation Dell dual XEON or I7 should
support seven.

Note Dell I7 Laptops support 32gb ram and 4 sata3 ports, DVD, C drive, esata on laptop and
esata on docking station.

*My workstation is an T7400(circa 2008) with 64gb ram(DDR2) and two raid 0 SSDs(sata II) arrays
of 4 disks each. You can get these off lease for about $500.

SPDE is so fast because it uses all three indexes, without SPDE SAS chooses just one index
the one with the highest cardinality. Note indexes can be slower than a table scan.
Don't use an index if pulling 15% or more from the slow EG drives.

Workstation gridding og the sums of squares for regression analysis can be extremely fast.
This is why ordinary least squares is so fast in Teradate.
Might be interesting to compare regression on workstation and Teradata.

EG is a good data farm for extrating data for the workstation to analyze.
Generally datasets <1TB can easily and inexpensively be handled on the desktop.
EG is also good as a learning tool for non-programmers.

    proc summary and proc means are two SAS jewels and this is core functionality not window dressing

    If you have missing class levels then it is impossible to add the type variable to the normalized
    proc summary output. This renders proc summary normalized output useless?

    Normailzed proc summarry output enables a wider range of algorithms. This is because
    the fat structure often requires progamming chages to handle the extra variables.

1. When I upload a microsoft docx file with a fixed font, ie courier new' ,Yammer seems to change the font to a proportional font. This destroys 'txt' tables.

2. I installed chrome without admin authority and I can now see the tools wheel, paper clip... But when I use the paperclip to embed a link in my conversation it does nothing. I do not use the paper clip to upload the file, I use the second bullet item 'add a yammer file'

3. When at work sometimes I get a message that 'single logon not supported', however if I retry later it seems to work.  Seems to work much better from home. I have put in a request for Chrome or Firefox. Microsoft will be discontinuing IE next year?

4. As noted before Yammer conversations do not support a fixed font or htm.

5. I could turn docx into png or pdf but that is too draconian for me.

6. It appears that Yammer only supports a single layer in pdfs.

7. I only need a 4 or 5 fonts, ie times, symbol, tacoma(web), italic and courier.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/538053866","","","","2015-05-19T13:11:36.298Z",""

For those among you who are open data enthusiasts and visionaries...

The HHS Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD) project is seeking an “Open Data Evangelist” detailee to take this initiative to the next level. 

DDOD reimagines the way HHS agencies (including CMS, FDA, NIH, CDC, AHRQ, ACF and others) deliver value with open data, in the process maximizing economic and public health impact. At its core, DDOD is a framework of tools and methods to provide a systematic, ongoing and transparent mechanism for industry and researchers to tell HHS what data they need in the form of “use cases”. With DDOD, open data efforts are managed in terms of ""use cases"", enabling better allocation of limited resources and ensuring that each release has real and immediate value. 

As Evangelist, you’ll have an opportunity to closely interact with program owners across HHS’s 11 agencies in order to execute on the DDOD use cases. Your duties will include:
• Plan out and manage each use case as an independent project, while looking for efficiencies to improve DDOD scalability. 
• Give presentations on the benefits and logistics around DDOD to wide audiences in an effort to built the brand, gain support from program owners and generate new use cases from user communities.
• Work with external organizations to understand their requests, set up collaborations on solution implementations, and ensure their needs are being addressed. 
• Work with program owners to find incentives for them to actively participate in DDOD, ensure they understand how to work through their use case, and help them arrange collaborations with data requesters.
• Document solutions identified in DDOD’s public knowledge base -- both short term workarounds and long term implementations.
• Make arrangements for systems implementation, data hosting, additional indexing on HealthData.gov, and validation testing. 

You’ll work out of the HHS IDEA Lab for a period of 6-12 months. This is an ideal opportunity for an individual with a desire and ability to quickly learn topics in the areas of healthcare and social services. You’ll return to your home agency with a deeper understanding of processes for leveraging data assets, as well as the experience in working across many agencies to maximize the value of these assets.

Logistics:
• Location of detail: HHS IDEA Lab offices (Washington, DC), with telecommute possible
• Duration: 6-12 months, but negotiable
• Reimbursement: Would need to come from offering agency
• Applying: Contact me by June 30 indicating your interest. Feel free to review the project website at http://ddod.us and contact me with questions.

Some good news and some not so good news.

The COMMON SAS folder is back and you can now store files and SAS datasets in your personal files area.

I do suggest users log completely log off EG and the virtual desktop at least twice a day.

However the PDAG folder is not back and I am only able to open one EG session.

The CCW will have been down (not really functional) for a week by 5pm tomorrow,  Because we were told it was functional Monday at 8am, I have wasted the better part two days trying to work around issues, some of which were fixed 'last night'. If 500 users are having similar problems this is a very expensive upgrade.

My $600 2008 Dell SAS 64gb workstation did not miss a beat. My workstation is roughly 5 times faster than the CCW on tables less than 1TB.  I added 2 SSD RAID 0 arrays on separate channels and SAS SPDE for data partitioning and parallel index processing.

/* T806850 Adding your company theme to SAS created PPT slides(via Boxoft)

Win 7 32 bit Powerpoint 2010

Once you have created your slides using ODS PDF and converted them to
a ppt using the free BOXOFT PDF2PPT, you probably want to
add a powerpoint theme. Make sure you used a SAS template that
provides whitespace for the banner and slide number footnote.

If you have a company custom template click on it and
select all the slides, shift first slide then last slide,
Then go to design tab and chose tour compant theme then apply.
All slides will now have your theme and SAS foreground
bitmaps. Note you can move the both the theme and/or
the SAS image around

The following VBA macro will make the SAS bitmaps transparent
and the company theme will appear on each slide.

Note SAS does not provide the ability for a them using
the template. Since SAS titles always appear at the top of a
page you can imbed an image in title1. However I wanted the
company powerpoint theme.

Rise in Suicide by Black Children Surprises Researchers - NYTimes.com

The suicide rate among black children has nearly doubled since the early 1990s, while the rate for white children has declined, a new study has found, an unusual pattern that seemed to suggest something troubling was happening among some of the nation’s most vulnerable citizens

CareFirst, an affiliate of the Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance company, announced it has recently learned it was the target of a cyber attack in June 2014, resulting in unauthorized access to a CareFirst database. Personally-identifiable information, including names, birthdays, e-mail addresses, and member-created user names and health plan identification numbers were compromised for current and former CareFirst enrollees who registered to use CareFirst's web site and online services prior to June 20, 2014.  The company has confirmed that approximately 1.1 million individuals are affected. Some federal employees and retirees are enrolled in CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans that are offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

CareFirst's President and CEO stated that no member-created passwords were compromised, as the targeted database did not contain password information, and further that no enrollee Social Security numbers, medical claims, employment information, credit card numbers or other financial information were accessed or in any way compromised. However, CareFirst will block access to all impacted enrollee accounts and will require affected enrollees to create new user names and passwords.

Additionally, CareFirst has announced that it will provide credit monitoring and identity theft protection services free of charge for two years to impacted individuals.  All affected individuals will receive a mailed letter from CareFirst, which will include needed information to enroll in these protection services. Members should also be aware that fraudsters have used prior announcements of health plan cyber attacks as a way to further prey on potential victims, and remember that CareFirst will not be contacting any individuals by phone or e-mail.  CareFirst has posted information about this cyber attack at http://www.carefirstanswers.com/.

I also recommend visiting the Federal Trade Commission's web site that provides guidance for what to do in these types of situations.

MAY 23, 1825: British scientist William Sturgeon, who had invented the electromagnet in 1824, exhibited the electromagnet in a practical form for the first time on this date. The exhibition accompanied the reading of a paper, recorded in the Transactions of the Society of Arts for 1825 (Vol xliii, p.38). His first electromagnet was a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that was wrapped with about 18 turns of bare copper wire (insulated wire didn't exist yet). The iron was varnished to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell battery was applied.

MAY 24, 1844: Samuel Morse sent the message “What hath God wrought” from the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the United States Capitol to the Mount Clair train depot in Baltimore, Maryland. It was the first public demonstration of the telegraph.


MAY 25, 1989: The first Magellan GPS NAV 1000s were shipped to retailers. They ran for a few hours on six AA batteries, and sold for $3,000.

For those among you who are open data enthusiasts and visionaries...

The HHS Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD) project is seeking an “Open Data Evangelist” detailee to take this initiative to the next level.  

DDOD reimagines the way HHS agencies (including CMS, FDA, NIH, CDC, AHRQ, ACF and others) deliver value with open data, in the process maximizing economic and public health impact.  At its core, DDOD is a framework of tools and methods to provide a systematic, ongoing and transparent mechanism for industry and researchers to tell HHS what data they need in the form of “use cases”.  With DDOD, open data efforts are managed in terms of ""use cases"", enabling better allocation of limited resources and ensuring that each release has real and immediate value.  

As Evangelist, you’ll have an opportunity to closely interact with program owners across HHS’s 11 agencies in order to execute on the DDOD use cases.  Your duties will include:
  •   Plan out and manage each use case as an independent project, while looking for efficiencies to improve DDOD scalability.  
  •   Give presentations on the benefits and logistics around DDOD to wide audiences in an effort to built the brand, gain support from program owners and generate new use cases from user communities.
  •   Work with external organizations to understand their requests, set up collaborations on solution implementations, and ensure their needs are being addressed.  
  •   Work with program owners to find incentives for them to actively participate in DDOD, ensure they understand how to work through their use case, and help them arrange collaborations with data requesters.
  •   Document solutions identified in DDOD’s public knowledge base -- both short term workarounds and long term implementations.
  •   Make arrangements for systems implementation, data hosting, additional indexing on HealthData.gov, and validation testing.  

You’ll work out of the HHS IDEA Lab for a period of 6-12 months.  This is an ideal opportunity for an individual with a desire and ability to quickly learn topics in the areas of healthcare and social services.  You’ll return to your home agency with a deeper understanding of processes for leveraging data assets, as well as the experience in working across many agencies to maximize the value of these assets.

Logistics:
  •   Location of detail: HHS IDEA Lab offices (Washington, DC), with telecommute possible
  •   Duration: 6-12 months, but negotiable
  •   Reimbursement: Would need to come from offering agency
  •   Applying: Contact me by June 30 indicating your interest.  Feel free to review the project website at http://ddod.us and contact me with questions.

The Federal Salary Council (FSC) met on October 17, 2014, and the FSC once again recommended adding 12 new locality pay areas based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) demonstrating that private sector pay in these areas far exceed the rates in the “Rest of U.S.” areas:
 
·         Albany-Schenectady-Amsterdam, NY Combined Statistical Area;
·         Albuquerque, NM Metropolitan Statistical Area;
·         Austin-Round Rock-Marble Falls, TX Combined Statistical Area;
·         Charlotte-Gastonia-Salisbury, NC-SC Combined Statistical Area;
·         Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area;
·         Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, IA-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area;
·         Harrisburg-Carlisle-Lebanon, PA Combined Statistical Area;
·         Laredo, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area;
·         Las Vegas-Paradise-Pahrump, NV Combined Statistical Area;
·         Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area;
·         St. Louis-St. Charles-Farmington, MO-IL Combined Statistical Area; and
·         Tucson, AZ Metropolitan Statistical Area.

These 12 areas have been included in the FSC’s recommendations for the last two years, but have not yet been acted upon.  Although the President’s Pay Agent gave tentative approval to adopt these new areas, no action was taken to publish the necessary regulations required to implement these new locality pay areas, presumably because the President’s Alternative Pay Plan did not provide any funding for locality pay increases.
 
The FSC also recommended, based on the BLS data, that Kansas City also be added as a separate locality pay area, NTEU also continued to recommend the expansion of many other existing locality pay areas to better reflect local labor markets based on available commuting data and changes to the boundaries of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget based on 2010 census data. 
 
The Office of Personnel Management has notified NTEU that the necessary regulations will be published for public comment by the end of May, 2015 to designate these 13 areas as new locality pay areas.

This should result in formal approval of these 13 new locality areas by year-end.  I will keep you updated once the regulations are published for public comment and as the public comment period on the regulations proceeds.
 
The remaining question will then be when funding is provided towards locality pay for future January pay adjustments.  NTEU’s efforts on that front will continue, of course, and I will keep you informed of any developments.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/541742577","","","","2015-05-28T13:53:53.174Z",""

At my GS level, I'll stick with ""Business Intelligence for Dummies"" at a more affordable $23.97.

What exactly is ‘acceptable’ is unclear. But a justification that the roads immediately surrounding the employee’s residence (or the office) are flooded; or that there is no mass transit option in lieu of driving (maybe the buses/trains are shut down, or maybe the residence and/or office isn’t near mass transit); and add that the mayor declared a state of emergency or at least suggested that people stay home. Include news reports and photography (if available) as evidence of the conditions.
 
Please do this on a case-by-case basis, since only certain parts of the Houston area flooded and others did not due to drainage, elevation, proximity to Buffalo Bayou, etc. I ask you to be completely honest in your request to avoid negative repercussions.
 
If management denies granting excused absence or administrative leave to an employee, he or she has 30 days from the date when management communicates his or her decision to the employee to file a grievance.

I don't have the details but I got a glowing review via email that we were will be getting 'enhanced' laptops.

My major concern is the ability of Windows 8 to bypass local processing and boot to a server.

I can't imagine EXCEL/SAS/WPS/R/Python/Perl programmers losing local processing?

Here is my ideal laptop for parallel SAS processing

1.  5th generation I7 with 32gb ram

2.  Three 500gb SSD drives 2 on RAID 0, Dell I7 with docking station supports 3 SSD drives. One external and one in the CDROM tray. All esata 6gbs. Dell BIOS supports RAID 0.

3. SAS  SPDE(Scalable Performance Data Environment) free with base.
Partitioned data and parallel processing on indexes.

4. It is very easy to grid 8 jobs on a laptop with SAS. I think I have a posting on this.

This setup is probably and order of magnitude faster than servers for tables up to 500gb. My personal workstation, 2008 dell T7400 supports tables up to 1tb.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/542268404","","","","2015-05-29T15:14:49.936Z",""

two datasets, one with females and one with males.

The code below will work for any dataset/R dataframe and
splitting variable.

Generally it is not a good idea to split a large dataset, however
if you need to partition the data for parallel processing this 
may be useful.

see fro code and details
https://www.yammer.com/hhs.gov/uploaded_files/36735688

LARGE DATASET AND SMALL DATASET SOLUTIONS ARE GIVEN

1. R soluton is one line of code. This splits class
   into dataframes res$F and res$F where res is a list

   res<-split(class, list(class$SEX), drop = TRUE);

2. SAS HASH solution. Like R this is an in memory solution
   good for smaller datasets. First the female records
   are loaded into memory and then sent out to the
   F dataset, then the males areloaded and output.

3. This is a solution for large datasets.
   First we create a macro string containing all
   the levels. Just male and female for outr example.
   The we use a datastep to build the following program.

   Only one line has to changed on the program to do another dataset

   data F M;
      set sashelp.class;
      select (sex);
         when ('F')  output F;
         when ('M')  output M;

I've been watching a lot of Super Soul Sunday lately. I so appreciate Oprah's mission of helping others to fully see their purpose in life.  She brings out some really great truths and nuggets of wisdom in this interview.  Some of my favorites (in no particular order):  

1) Luck is being prepared in the moment of opportunity.
2) There is no DOING without BEING.
3) All people seek validation first.  They want to know if you are fully here with them: did you hear me? did you see me? did you understand me? -we can't lead people without recognizing this important fact.
4) When trying to make a change in the world, you must recognize that the person must first change how they think and how they see themself.
5) Her quote from ""Seed of the Soul"" - ""When the personality comes to serve the energy of your soul -that is authentic empowerment.""
6) Our number one job is to find our purpose (Why are we here?) and align our personality, gifts and talents with that purpose.
7) Failure is there to point you in a different direction.  When you find yourself in this space, get still and ask what is the next right move?
8) You cannot help others if you do not keep yourself full.

1. Download R from

   https://www.yammer.com/hhs.gov/uploaded_files/36792999

2, Unzip to C drive. You should get folder  R-3.1.2.

3. You can now run R from the command line

   Open a DOS command window ie START->CMD
   'cd C:\R-3.1.2\bin'
   enter 'R'

   You can istall packages from here

4. I use SAS as a editor for R but you have to invoke
   SAS with the -RLANG option

   Here is my sas invocation (you don't need all this stuff)
   My init folder is c:\utl

    c:\xxxxxxx\SASFoundation\9.4\sas.exe
    -work c:\wrk
    -sasuser c:\etc

  You also need this line in your SAS config

SAS IEEE Double Floats are transferred to and from R without any loss of precision.
Long variable names can be used.
However the max length for character variables is 244 bytes
SAS PC Files product is needed, but you do not need STATA.
STATA ‘dta’ files are used for transferring the data  from R

Note I tried all of the methods below and they all failed

1. SAS transport saves floats in IBM mainframe format and losses precision
(IEEE 11 bit exponent -  IBM 8 bit exponent)
and SAS transport does not support long variable names or long character strings(200 max)

2. SAS XML uses the BASE64 representation of IBM floats for IEE Floats (ie like the xport)

3. RODBC(sqldf) to MS-Access does not allow assigning lengths to character variables
You can only set the default length of all character variables?

4. SPSS I could not get R to create sav files.

5. SAS nad R do not support the latest version of DBF files, which handles double floats.

6. Excel and csv have precision, type, length and control character issues.

I had posted this overview of the literature I found in the ""Notes"" area on Monday, but realize that it should probably go here instead.  The attachments were posted in the ""Files"" section.  Thanks:
-------------------------------
Good Morning All,

Just wanted to share what I've found so far to get us primed for our meeting with Des in a few weeks.  I've posted a few documents/pdfs, each providing some new information about the purpose, form, and function of structured governance plans.

1.  ""Overview"".pdf- This is essentially a brochure for Deloitte execs and management teams reviewing the purpose, components, and benefits of developing a governance structure. 

2.  ""Chapter"".pdf- Provides expanded definintions and guidance on the components of a governenance plan, including how to identify and organize the framework (presented with an IT governance example).

3.  ""Template"".doc- A comprehensive template for a potential governance plan, includes specific guidance for each bullet, but no sample content.

4.  ""Example HHS Governance Plan"".pdf- Provides a completed governance plan developed for the HHS Enterprise Architecture system.  Identies rolees, responsibility, strucure, and processes.  Very technical document.  I found it interesting to compare the actual governance plan (internal, living, detailed product) against the organization's webpage, which provides a great (brief) overview of the structure for the public and stakeholders: http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/ea/architecture/.

Additionally, I’d like to discuss the attached memo (pdf file) that documents OLABs concerns and their application to our mandatory grants module requirements.
Also for your consideration, I’ve attached a Microsoft Visio (it opens in Internet Explorer) and Excel document that Patrick and his team recently created to document their perspectives.

SAS programmer with or without a locked down EG server?

I define big data as computing problems where most
of a users programming involves tables over 1TB. The other place for larger servers is
massive simulations or parallelism over 64 concurrent jobs. Workstations are available
with 64 cores. Even fifth generation multi-threaded  I7 processors can handle 16
parallel jobs.

Should I use just the server or a sever plus workstation(or power laptop) for my SAS programming.
Systems like Tableau, Oracle, Teradata, Midas and the IDR do not run well on a workstation.

This is how IBM used to measure overall mainframe usability.

  1. Reliability -   Do you get the answer you expect.
  2. Availability.   
  3. Serviciability
  4. Performance
  5. Functionality
  6. Security

I use either excel or SAS running on both platforms for comparisons.

  1. Reliability ( Do I get the result I expect?)
      There was a bug in SAS 9.3 where 'proc sql distinct' gave the wrong answer for very high
      carinality.
         Workstation: I downloaded the fix from SAS and installed it on my workstation in 30 minutes
         Server:      Reported it a couple of months ago and it is still not fixed

  2. Availability.
      Workstation: 99.9%
      Server:      75% (Mostly due to the fact that you need an internet connection and scheduled
      and non scheduled availability. 

  3. Serviceability:
      Workstation: I added a second esata III SSD to my laptop in 5 minutes
      Server: Generally not possible

  4. Performance
      Workstation: Much more ram,RAID 0 SSD drives and 100% of the XEONs. Very fast response time
                   not like a server dial-up connection. RAID 0 is ok because server has backup.
                   Dell laptop BIOS supports RAID 0/
      Server: Little Ram, SAN spinning raid 5 drives

  5. Functionality
      Workstation: You have an operating system, R, Python, Ghostscript, Perl, C, Java...
                   ODBC(excel access...), more disk space(Try getting 5TB ob the server)...
      Server:      Generally locked down most of the above not available.

  6.  Security
        Workstation: Only have a subset of data. Local and disk encryption.
        Server: Has the jewels so obviously a better targer for hackes.

FYI: I jsut saw a 5TB drive for $150 and very fast flash drives less than $800.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/544757508","","","","2015-06-04T15:26:54.686Z",""

I ran the Verification and Validation macro on  SASHELP.ZIPCODES

Here are some of the interesting discoveries

1.  NO need for PONAME and CITY - They are exact duplicates? (note same number unique vals is also a tipoff)
2.  ZIP is a primary key
3.  Using optimum lengths reduces the size of the dataset by 72 bytes (fat variables should be codes)
4.  Longitude is very strongly related to numeric zipcode spearman cor of 0.96
5.  Greenwich meantime is related to zipcode, since it is a measure of longitude?
6.  Outlier analysis through univariate
7   One to One      GMTOFFSET to TIMEZONE
8   One to One      STATE to STATECODE
9   One to One      STATE to STATENAME
10  The strongest association between unordered catagorical variabkes is STATE * STATECODE
11  The weakest is Rand_A * Rand_B (random numbers)

Incidentally I am adding code to compute the cardinality relationship between two variables

Frequency of these relationships

Babbage was known for his designs of early calculating machines, the ""Difference Engine"" (1823) and ""Analytical Engine"" (1834). Although he never completed the machines, Babbage became a father of computing after his close friend Ada published a description of his work. She understood the plans for the device as well as Babbage but was better at articulating its promise. Although Babbage and his assistants had sketched out programs for his engines before, Lovelace’s are the most elaborate and complete, and the first to be published; so she is often referred to as “the first computer programmer.”

JDBF

Here is what I am working on.
DBASE 7 supports binary IEEE 784 8 byte floats.
These are the floats SAS uses.
I would like to write a java program
to read and write DBASE 7 in both SAS
and R. This should allow R to export
IEEE 8 byte floats and char variables
back and forth to R.
With only base SAS.


* My JAVA skills are poor if anyone wishes to help or
complete the SAS or R version I would be grateful.

SAS and R do not appear to handle raw IEEE doubles.
Conversion from decimal ie 123.76 to IEEE 8 byte is 
costly and imprecise, especially for constants like
SAS constant('BIG'), PI ...

* CREATE A DBF ;
* found this on the web ;
* I have the supporting JARS;

Here is an example of a command macro                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                        
Highlight

  2*3**4*exp(4)

Then type evl on the command line and the result will be in your log.

This only works in the old text editor because SAS script commands are
disabled in all other SAS editors, ie 'STORE' command is disabled.

Even though it takes two macros to execute evl just put both of them
in evl.sas in your autocall library.

Note you use function keys or mouse actions to execute these macros, see below.
Will show you how to map 20 of these command macros to mouse actions later.

How to map macros to mouse actions to follow.

This only works in the old editor because powerfull script commands like 'STORE'
are disabled in all other SAS editors,                                                             
                                                                                                                                        
Here is what is in the package  (* most used or most critical)                                                                          
You can build on these macros they are just minimal SAS code.

Overview
Smoking is the largest cause of preventable mortality in the U.S. and the world, and over 40 million Americans are current cigarette smokers. Despite strong adverse consequences of smoking, cessation remains a difficult goal, and over half of current smokers report making a quit attempt in the previous year.  Clear evidence now shows that heaviness of smoking is driven by genetic variation in cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit genes and nicotine metabolizing genes.  These same variants predict failed smoking cessation and are the strongest genetic risk factors for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Importantly, there is evidence of a complex interplay between environments, pharmacologic treatment, and genes in the prediction successful smoking cessation. This body of work illustrates an example in achieving our goal of precision medicine: using genetic information to differentiate people who are likely to respond to pharmacologic treatment for smoking cessation from those who will likely receive little benefit.

As shared with you earlier, OPM announced last week that a database breach has compromised Personal Identifiable Information for approximately four million current and former federal employees. 

OPM’s Chief Information Officer has now confirmed that the compromised employee personnel records contained names, Social Security numbers, place and date of birth, and addresses.

On a rolling basis starting today through Friday, June 19, OPM is notifying affected individuals by email or mailed letter through the U.S. Postal Service, and will provide credit monitoring and identity theft protection services from CSID, a company that specializes in identity theft and fraud protection.

According to OPM, individual notification emails will be sent from opmcio@csid.com. The e-mail and letters will contain needed instructions and PIN codes in order to access the CSID identity protection services provided by OPM. 

Once an affected individual has received the needed instructions and PIN, they can visit the CSID website at http://www.csid.com/opm/ in order to enroll in the protection services.  

Please note, individuals can also directly call CSID toll-free at 844-222-2743 (international callers 512-327-0700 collect) to verify whether they are affected and to enroll in these services. 

NTEU shared our members’ valid concerns over the need to properly safeguard employee data, and they are working to better understand what exact types of data have been compromised, as well as additional details on the notification process itself.

I will keep you updated.","https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/546333717","","","","2015-06-09T12:03:14.783Z",""

Using the prefix area

ps You an have multiple old text editors using the cntl-h function key or
typing note g.g on the command line. Putting 'notesubmit' on a function key allows
execution of program in a note editor.

There are later logitech drivers that work with the MX310 even though Logitech says
no software is available. Just Google around.

You do need admin rights to install this mouse, but I
was easily able to get permission from my Gov IT group

I have twenty actions assigned tot he mouse. the picture
of the mouse during install may be greyed out but this is just because it failed to display.
It has no effect on functionality. Not sure why some are having fifficulty.

There is a map of the mouse actions within the ut_perpac_setup/utl_PerPacLft.jpg.

If you use my function keys, command macros and my autoexec(only needed for versioning) you will need to
assign the following keystrokes to the mouse.

You will see 6 possible assigments in the select button option

1  Left mouse button just use SAS function settings as shown in utl_perpackey.txt.
2  Right mouse button just use SAS function settings as shown in utl_perpackey.txt.

Keystroke assigments
3 assign F1    - Scroll wheel Middle mouse button
4 assign F11   - Left side mouse button
5 assign F12   - Right side mouse button
6 assign F2    - Seond middle mouse button

You get twenty actions out of these settings because SAS function keys allow combination
keystrokes, ie shift-f1 lists forty obs from last table created.

Note you do not have to enter all those function keys and you can save your keys or backup
your whole profile before switching to my keys. You can have several sets of keys and swap them
without leaving SAS. Keys can be assigned to different SAS windows.

To try my keys, copy profile.sasbcat to some directory. Then type keys and on the keys
command line type copy myfolder.profile.dmkeys.keys.


Also you may want to try my invocation and profile.sas7bcat. The CPT file can be used for 23bit, however it does completly set up the environment

Settings I like

You can save these settings and I guarantee you can just plot your profile.sas7bdat into the
next version of SAS and all your function keys and command macros will work.

I gave up with EG, I lose my settings several times a year and have neven been able to migrate them.

1. Turn off enhanced editor go to view->program editor. I also like to minimize the enhanced editor
so that if it pops up it will look like a postage stamp.

2. -awscontrol notitle? on SAS invocation ( removes blue banner -need wtattention on function key -
cntl_alt_delete for more stuborn freezes. This will attempt to bring up the SAS termination menue.
SAS has not made all processes interruptible)

3. tools>options>preferences

general tab -- 30 entries (able to undo last 30 changes)

view tab -- turn off horizontal/scroll vertical scroll/screen tips (f3-f4 lrft right)
There is a bug when removing the verrticle scrool bar in the old text editor. It disables
mouse scroll wheel and limits what you can highlight.  F1 and F2 to scroll left and right)

turn on command line
make sure command bar is off.

edit tab -- autosave every minute

results tab -- turn on create listing (all else off - less is more) and other automatic
output. You decide when you want to see something with functions keys,

advanced tab -- turn on hide cursor and disable scroll bar focus

4. tools>cutomize
toolbar -- turn all four boxes off
When editor comes up you should see a clean single command line on all windows.

The command bar and line below command line should be gone

"547016300","","547016300","","5342846","NTEU Chapter 254","","true","false","1498906457","User","David Arvelo","david.arvelo@fda.hhs.gov","What happened?

Within the last year, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has undertaken an aggressive effort to update its cybersecurity posture, adding numerous tools and capabilities to its various networks. As a result, in April 2015, OPM became aware of a cybersecurity intrusion affecting its information technology (IT) systems and data. 

Since the incident was identified, OPM has partnered with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security U.S. Cyber Incident Response Team (US-CERT), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine the impact current and former to Federal personnel.  OPM immediately implemented additional security measures and will continue to improve the security for the sensitive information it manages. The FBI has opened an investigation in order to identify and hold accountable the person(s) responsible for this incident.

OPM will send notifications to approximately 4 million individuals whose PII may have been compromised.  Since the investigation is on-going, additional PII exposures may come to light; in that case, OPM will conduct additional notifications as necessary. In order to mitigate the risk of fraud and identity theft, OPM will offer credit report access, credit monitoring and identify theft insurance and recovery services at no cost to them, through CSID®, a company that specializes in identity theft protection and fraud resolution.

Were these employees OPM employees or employees from across the executive branch? Was the legislative or judicial branch impacted by this intrusion?

OPM services the Federal workforce so the affected population includes Executive Branch agencies and employees.

Were members of the military affected by the breach?

This incident did not affect military records. No contractors were affected unless they previously held Federal civilian positions. The incident affected current and former Federal civilian personnel, including Department of Defense civilian employees.

Have the police been notified? If so, with which police department and what is the case number?

Since the incident was identified, OPM has partnered with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to determine the full impact to Federal personnel and investigate the intrusion. Federal law enforcement continues to investigate the matter and assist with remediation efforts. OPM immediately implemented additional security measures and will continue to improve security for the sensitive information it manages.

When did this happen?

The intrusion occurred in December 2014. OPM became aware of the intrusion into its systems in April 2015 after implementing tough new measures to deter and detect cyberattacks.  During its investigation with its agency partners, the FBI and US-CERT, OPM became aware of potentially compromised data in May 2015.

What systems were affected?

For security reasons, OPM cannot publicly discuss specifics of the systems that might be affected by the compromise of personnel data.  Additionally, due to the ongoing investigation, it would be inappropriate to publicly provide information that may impact current work by law enforcement. OPM has added additional security controls to better protect overall networks and systems and the data they store and process.

What personal information was compromised?

OPM maintains personnel records for the Federal workforce.  The kind of data that may have been compromised in this incident could include name, Social Security Number, date and place of birth, and current and former addresses. It is the type of information you would typically find in a personnel file, such as job assignments, training records, and benefit selection decisions, but not the names of family members or beneficiaries and not information contained in actual policies. The notifications to potentially affected individuals will state exactly what information may have been compromised.

How many people are involved?

Approximately 4 million current and former Federal employees are involved.

Why didn't OPM tell affected individuals about the loss of the data sooner?

OPM became aware of the intrusion in April 2015. OPM worked with US-CERT as quickly as possible to assess the extent of the malicious activity and to identify the records that may have been compromised.  During the investigation, OPM became aware of potentially compromised data in May 2015. As with any such event, it takes time to conduct a thorough investigation and to identify the affected individuals.

It is important to note that this is an ongoing investigation that could reveal additional exposure; if that occurs, OPM will conduct additional notifications as necessary. Protecting the integrity of the information entrusted to OPM is the agency’s highest priority.

What is OPM doing to prevent this kind of loss from happening again?

Because cyber threats are evolving and pervasive, OPM is continuously working to identify and mitigate threats when they occur. OPM evaluates its IT security protocols on a continuous basis to make sure that sensitive data is protected to the greatest extent possible, across all networks where OPM data resides—including those managed by government partners and contractors.

Has the information been misused?

At this time, we have no evidence that there has been any use or attempted use of the information compromised in this incident. This is an ongoing investigation and OPM will continue to be vigilant to ensure that necessary security measures are in place to further strengthen and protect our networks, systems, and data.

I did not receive a letter stating that my information was compromised, but feel that I should have. Can you help me?

OPM is aware of the affected data and the networks and the data on which it resides. OPM will begin sending notifications to individuals whose PII may have been compromised on June 8, 2015. These notifications will take place on a rolling basis through June 19, 2015. The email will come from opmcio@csid.com and it will contain information regarding credit monitoring and identity theft protection services being provided to those Federal employees impacted by the data breach. In the event OPM does not have an email address for the individual on file, a standard letter will be sent via the U.S. Postal Service.

What are the risks of identity theft with the information that was compromised?

Receiving a letter does not mean that the recipient is a victim of identity theft.  OPM is recommending that people review their letters and the recommendations provided.  In order to mitigate the risk of fraud and identity theft, we are offering credit monitoring service and identity theft insurance through CSID, a company that specializes in identity theft protection and fraud resolution. All potentially affected individuals will receive a complimentary subscription to CSID Protector Plus for 18 months.  Every affected individual, regardless of whether or not they explicitly take action to enroll, will have $1 million of identity theft insurance and access to full-service identity restoration provided by CSID.

How long will it take to inform all the potential victims involved in the incident?

OPM will begin conducting notifications to affected individuals using email and/or USPS First Class mail on June 8, 2015 and will continue notifications on a rolling basis through June 19, 2015.

Who is responsible for this incident?

OPM does not assign attribution for cybercrimes. That question is best addressed by law enforcement agencies.

What has been the operational or mission impact to OPM?

There has been no operational impact to OPM. OPM has continued to operate at full capacity since the incident occurred.

Can my family members also receive services if they are part of my file/records?

Family members of employees were not affected by this breach.

Takeaways for me were: DBs allow a system overview on one screen, with timelier data and more easily-customizable drill-downs that  better match needs. These advantages should allow better decisions - IF decision-makers know how to exploit such opportunities. Got any HHS examples of executive-level ability? Let the group know!

Experimenting with the new ODS EXCEL Destination

  Good Programmers write there own code, great ones steal.
  This is stolen stuff from all over the internet, thanks all of you.
  Special thanks to Chris Hemedinger and Eric Gebhart

  1. Has examples of style elements, inline tags, textdecoration,
     tagattr, rotated headings, data superscripts, data subscripts,
     autofilters, froxen headers, ods text, titles, footnotes,
     heading superscripts and heading subscripts.
  2. Creates two workbooks with one sheet in each workbook.
  3. Shows two methods to add 'DATA' sheets to either workbook.
  4. Has a macro to copy sheets from one workbook to another.
     The sheets can have graphs, data, formulas.. or combinations
     and will be added(cloned) to the second workbook.

Notes: (may not be totally correct - my observations)

  1. Option ""Start_at"" only uses last instance. It messes up other settings(autofilter?)?
     Do not use?
  2. Results are sensitive to location of 'ods text' and 'titles' and 'footnotes'. Put titles and footnotes at top?
  3. Cell with in percentages sort of works but no way to set overall width so percetages are useless?
  4. Absolute_column_width is not needed. Better to use cell_width?
  5. I think SAS is creating a zipped IML file ala newer xlsx files?
  6. tagattr not needed as often because sas formats, inline tags and style statements are honored?
  7. Need to nest {{{}}} to get all inline formatting to be honored.
  8. SAS only supports adding data sheets to an existing workbook?
  9. Macro included that uses powershell to copy a sheet from one workbook
     to another workbook. Really wanted to use R but could not figure out how.
     Python can do it cross platform. Unfortunately I fell back on windows only powershell,
     Afte rall Gates only have about 100 billion dollars.
 10. Because ods excel seems to honor SAS formats, I suspect tagattr may not be as useful.
     Howver it is useful for totating headers. style(header)={tagattr='rotate:45'} - see below
 11. Also if proc report is your preferred reporting tool then user templates may not be needed.

Updated Information on OPM Data Breach

NTEU has received regular briefings from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), with new information being provided almost daily. NTEU understands and shares the high frustration you are feeling at this time. 

The union received an updated toll-free number and new information concerning the credit monitoring and identity-theft protection services being provided. 

Here is the latest information:

• Notifications are being sent to affected individuals, a process that began Monday, June 8 and will continue through Friday, June 19. CSID is a private contractor that OPM is using to assist with responding to the data breach. Notifications will include a PIN that is required when signing up for credit monitoring and identity-theft protection services. 

• Current employees are most likely to receive an email from CSID at their work email address. Notification emails sent by CSID will come from opmcio@csid.com. Employees without a valid email address and annuitants will be contacted by mail. 

• OPM alerted NTEU that the telephone numbers provided in earlier communications are incorrect. The correct CSID toll-free number is 844-777-2743. International callers can call collect to 512-327-0705. 

• OPM advises that it is best for individuals to wait to receive a notice before calling CSID or visiting the CSID web site at: http://www.csid.com/opm/. 

• At no time will affected individuals receive incoming calls or emails from CSID requesting or demanding personal information. While they will receive a notification via email or postal mail, affected individuals must still take action to sign up for credit monitoring—either by visiting the web site or calling the toll-free line—before any request for personal information occurs. 

• When affected individuals call the toll-free line, CSID representatives initially will not ask for date of birth or full Social Security number (SSN). CSID representatives on the toll-free line only have the following information: the names of affected individuals, the PIN that is included in their individual notices, and the last four digits of employees’ Social Security numbers. Representatives will only initially ask for the PIN or the last 4 digits of the SSN to help validate individual identities against the lists that they have. 

• At NTEU’s request, OPM has contacted agencies asking them to allow employees to reach out to CSID while at work and on duty time and to provide Internet access to employees who do not have regular access at work.

OPM Updated FAQ: http://www.opm.gov/faqs/topic/cybersecurityinformation/

The union will continue to urge OPM to share all available information as the situation develops and will keep members informed.

Overview
Minority stress theory describes stress processes that stem from stigma and prejudice experienced by lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender individuals (LGBT) and that place LGBT people at risk for adverse mental and physical health outcomes.  Hundreds of research articles since the 1990s have shown that minority stress processes lead to mental and physical health problems.  Most of this research has focused on LGB people but more recently research on transgender populations has articulated minority stress processes and has demonstrated its impact on the health of transgender people. Minority stress, like general stress theory, also suggests that against minority stress, LGBT people mount coping responses.  According to theory, the impact of stress on health is determined by the countervailing effects of pathogenic stress processes and ameliorative resilience processes. In general, resilience research has shown that in various populations, starting early in childhood, individuals mount significant, sometimes heroic, coping efforts in the face of stress and adversity.  But research on ameliorating (or salutogenic—health inducing) processes in LGBT populations has lagged.  This Fall, a special issue of Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity, guest edited by Dr. Ilan H. Meyer, comes to feel a gap in the literature on resilience in LGBT people.  In this Webinar we will highlight 3 areas of research on resilience that have not yet received much attention.  The areas covered include individual/psychological level resilience, social/community level resilience, and resilience intervention in sexual and gender minority youth.

For those among you who are open data enthusiasts and visionaries...

The HHS Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD) project is seeking an “Open Data Evangelist” detailee to take this initiative to the next level.  

DDOD reimagines the way HHS agencies (including CMS, FDA, NIH, CDC, AHRQ, ACF and others) deliver value with open data, in the process maximizing economic and public health impact.  At its core, DDOD is a framework of tools and methods to provide a systematic, ongoing and transparent mechanism for industry and researchers to tell HHS what data they need in the form of “use cases”.  With DDOD, open data efforts are managed in terms of ""use cases"", enabling better allocation of limited resources and ensuring that each release has real and immediate value.  

As Evangelist, you’ll have an opportunity to closely interact with program owners across HHS’s 11 agencies in order to execute on the DDOD use cases.  Your duties will include:
  •   Plan out and manage each use case as an independent project, while looking for efficiencies to improve DDOD scalability.  
  •   Give presentations on the benefits and logistics around DDOD to wide audiences in an effort to built the brand, gain support from program owners and generate new use cases from user communities.
  •   Work with external organizations to understand their requests, set up collaborations on solution implementations, and ensure their needs are being addressed.  
  •   Work with program owners to find incentives for them to actively participate in DDOD, ensure they understand how to work through their use case, and help them arrange collaborations with data requesters.
  •   Document solutions identified in DDOD’s public knowledge base -- both short term workarounds and long term implementations.
  •   Make arrangements for systems implementation, data hosting, additional indexing on HealthData.gov, and validation testing.  

You’ll work out of the HHS IDEA Lab for a period of 6-12 months.  This is an ideal opportunity for an individual with a desire and ability to quickly learn topics in the areas of healthcare and social services.  You’ll return to your home agency with a deeper understanding of processes for leveraging data assets, as well as the experience in working across many agencies to maximize the value of these assets.

Logistics:
  •   Location of detail: HHS IDEA Lab offices (Washington, DC), with telecommute possible
  •   Duration: 6-12 months, but negotiable
  •   Reimbursement: Would need to come from offering agency
  •   Applying: Contact me by June 30 indicating your interest.  Feel free to review the project website at http://ddod.us and contact me with questions.

At this time, OPM has not announced a notification plan stemming from the June 12th announcement of a massive breach affecting background investigation records.  NTEU is aware that email and mailed letter notifications are in the process of going out from CSID, the OPM-selected contractor providing credit monitoring and identity theft protection services, for the June 4th OPM announcement. 

Given the large amount of remaining unknown information—as to who exactly has been hacked, and what exact information has been compromised, Colleen's letter to OPM Director Katherine Archuleta asks for an immediate briefing, as well as providing a series of recommendations that NTEU believes would assist federal employees and their family members at this time. See Colleen's letter attached.
