##DAT7 Project Question##

###Mike Yea###


*Project Question: After initial adoption in 2012, the opt-in use of Yammer, a workplace collaboration tool, has stagnated at my work.  Based on anecdotes and isolated experiences, my colleagues and I believe certain messages (i.e., posts) elicit more reaction from users of the tool.

	Can I predict “lift” in user engagement (e.g., likes, responses, reposts, sustained engagement) from message characteristics (e.g., message in the form of a question, link included, length of the message, topic/tag included, key words, sender ID/message poster)? 

*Data Description: While I can pull csv files (users table, message table), I would like to use the data export API, so I can write a script to pull data on a recurring basis (https://developer.yammer.com/v1.0/docs/data-export-api).  The documentation is weak, so my backup plan is to pull the csv files using the web interface.
